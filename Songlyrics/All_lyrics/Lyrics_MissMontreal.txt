I've been addicted to crying these days
I never thought it would happen to me
The long road went good, until last month
It seems to me that nobody stays

Everywone loses but I always win
They lay down beside me to say

Can you deal with this problem, that takes all your time
And I wanna cry
To think, how did you get there, people just die
And I wanna cry

Seeing the usual of everything
Exept when I know that you're here
I feel a presence, I hate to know you're here
So that is why I live day by day

Everyone loses but I always win
They lay down beside me to say

Can you deal with this problem, that takes all your time
And I wanna cry
To think, how did you get there, people just die
And I wanna cry
And I wanna cry

I'm waiting for you to tell you I need you
I'm waiting for you to tell you I need you
I need you nowadays

I've been addicted to crying these days
I never thought it would happen to me
The long road went good, until last month
It seems to me that nobody stays




 [Verse 1]
I see the tears on your face, how you're doing?
It might be hard, might be sad, that's a heartbreak
Take it in, slow it down
Take a breath, don't stop, let it out
No matter what, no matter how
Just take a breath, don't stop, let it out

[Chorus]
So why we act like we don't stay together
I'll find you in a million ways forever
I need you, I want you, just another day
So why we act like we don't stay together

[Verse 2]
First we say it's okay then we're sorry
So we come to the same, the same old story
Take it in, slow it down
Take a breath, don't stop, let it out
No matter what, no matter how
Just take a breath, don't stop, let it out

[Chorus]
So why we act like we don't stay together
I'll find you in a million ways forever
I need you, I want you, just another day
So why we act like we don't stay together
Together

[Chorus]
Why we act like we don't stay together
I'll find you in a million ways forever
I need you, I want you, just another day
So why we act like we don't stay together
Together
I need you, I want you, just another day
So why we act like we don't stay together




 They go marching after midnight
And their looking for the big fight
When they find you, you can't stop them
They get louder, the army in my head

They buried me with the words that they said tonight
The army in my head
They fuck me up and left me for dead, tonight

Television and a red wine
To keep busy with a clear mind
Close my eyes, I see them coming
Can't avoid them, the army in my head

They buried me with the words that they said tonight
The army in my head
They fuck me up and left me for dead, tonight

When the army in my head...
The minute that I see you
And when you say my name
I feel that I can fight them and keep them right there
When we are together, we make it through the night
You make me feel like I can surive

They buried me with the words that they said tonight
The army in my head
They fuck me up and left me for dead, tonight

They buried me with the words that they said tonight
The army in my head
They fuck me up and left me for dead, tonight

They buried me with the words that they said tonight
The army in my head
They fuck me up and left me for dead, tonight

[Verse 1]
Singing bells and snowy streets
All around the world
Happy faces everywhere
But your bed is cold

[Hook]
Embrace yourself like no one else could
Being alone at Christmas doesn't have to be a bad thing
Singing songs all for yourself
Some brandy, no one's leaving
And oooh you're alone tonight
Oooh no Christmas lights
No kisses, hugs, no love, no luck
Christmas a delight

[Verse 2]
Things will be okay
You'll see you won't be lonely
Maybe next year you and me
Around the Christmas tree

[Hook]
Embrace yourself like no one else could
Being alone at Christmas doesn't have to be a bad thing
Singing songs all for yourself
Some brandy, no one's leaving
Being alone at Christmas doesn't have to be a bad thing
Singing songs all for yourself
Some brandy, no one's leaving
Being alone at Christmas doesn't have to be a bad thing
Singing songs all for yourself
Some brandy, no one's leaving
And oooh you're alone tonight
Oooh no Christmas lights
No kisses, hugs, no love, no luck
Christmas a delight

[Outro]
We will be alright

Papapapaaa

 I had a bottle, all to myself
And now I’m lying out on the floor
Who knows how long I’ll be here?
And everybody says I’m a mess
But they ain’t got a clue who I am
I know I’m wrong, I don’t care
I like it better when it hurts
When the whole world knocks me down
It’s better when it burns
I’m just always gonna be that girl
I like it better when it hurts
I got a list of guys I can call
And they just give me all that I want
They all wanna try and save me
I’m not afraid to live in the dark
I come alive when I’m all alone
I know it is wrong, I don’t care
I like it better when it hurts
When the whole world knocks me down
It’s better when it burns
I’m just always gonna be that girl
I like it better when it hurts
When the whole world knocks me down
It’s better when it burns
I’m just always gonna be that girl
I like it better when it hurts
I had a bottle, all to myself
And now I’m lying out on the floor




 Love is multiply
At least a thousand times
Just like snowflakes falling from the skies

Seasons come and go
But everybody knows
It's the warmest time although it's cold outside
So we all stay home

It's the best time of the year

It won't matter where you are
We're forever young at heart
At Christmas time our hearts go:
Ding-a-dong, sing along, let me sing a song for you
Bells ring, we're all young again
We've got snowballs in our hands
That's when our Christmas hearts go:
Ding-a-dong, sing along, let me sing a heart for you

Presents filled with love
And answered with a hug
It's the warmest time although it's cold outside
So we all stay home
It's the best time of the year

It won't matter where you are
We're forever young at heart
At Christmas time our hearts go:
Ding-a-dong, sing along, let me sing a song for you
Bells ring, we're all young again
We've got snowballs in our hands
That's when our Christmas hearts go:
Ding-a-dong, sing along, let me sing a heart for you

(ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong)
(ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong)

It won't matter where you are
We're forever young at heart
At Christmas time our hearts go:
Ding-a-dong, sing along, let me sing a song for you
Bells ring, we're all young again
We've got snowballs in our hands
That's when our Christmas hearts go:
Ding-a-dong, sing along, let me sing a heart for you

(ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong)

That's when our Christmas hearts go:
Ding-a-dong, sing along, let me sing a heart for you, you




 Remember when the lights went out
And there we were, without an answer
To chase away the questions that we had
You played the part
You took me home
And taught me how to get along
With all the things
I wasn’t ready for
But here’s the thing
I want you with me
All the time
So please come on
Been here too long
I’m ready to move on
Hey, you know
You better make your move
Before I’m gone, for good
So tell me what you’re waiting for
C-C-C-C-Come on already
C-C-C-C-Come on already
Hey, you know
You better make your move
Before I’m gone, for good
So show me what I'm waiting for
C-C-C-C-Come on already
C-C-C-C-Come on already
I see us there
With everything we could ever want
With everything we could become
Who we were meant to be
But here’s the thing
I want you with me
All the time
So please come on
Been here too long
I’m ready to move on
Hey, you know
You better make your move
Before I’m gone, for good
So tell me what you're waiting for
C-C-C-C-Come on already
C-C-C-C-Come on already
Hey, you know
You better make your move
Before I’m gone, for good
Just show me what I'm waiting for
C-C-C-C-Come on already
C-C-C-C-Come on already
Hey, you know
You better make your move
Before I’m gone, for good
So tell me what you're waiting for
C-C-C-C-Come on already
C-C-C-C-Come on already
Hey, you know
You better make your move
Before I’m gone, for good
Just show me what I'm waiting for
C-C-C-C-Come on already
C-C-C-C-Come on already




 Craziest




 Go on make your move it's your favorite game
Taking abuse of my good grace
It's the thanks I get for protecting you
Years I spent I'm about to lose
I'm done with you
Cause you went too far to come back this time
I can see it in your eyes you have crossed a line
So I'm moving on nothing left to do
You can see it in my eyes I'm done
Done with you
Done with you
The forgive forget it went on too long
What we had is long been gone
The mistakes you made I'm still paying for
Spend a heart you could not afford
I'm done with you
Cause you went too far to come back this time
I can see it in your eyes you have crossed a line
So I'm moving on nothing left to do
You can see it in my eyes I'm done
Done with you
Done with you




 I've been giving you all my spare time
I've been saving up all of my best
Digging deep inside of me
So all of??? you see
But me
You've been listening to every word my heart speaks
You've been holding on to every last line
Singing all along with me
Giving back the melody
To me

And I swear that I feel a little closer to you every single time
I see you close your eyes
And then you go like

Oeh
Make the moment last forever
Oeh
All the voices sing together
This is what my dreams are made of
Oeh
So whatever you do, don't wake me up

I am losing count how many times you have listened
I could die today knowing that I've lived
And it's all because of you
And everything that we've gone through

And I swear that I feel a little closer to you every single time
I see you close your eyes
And then you go like:

Oeh
Make the moment last forever
Oeh
All the voices sing together
This is what my dreams are made of
Oeh
So whatever you do, don't wake me up

Up up up up up up up up up
Whatever you do
Whatever you do
Don't wake me up
Up up up up up up up up
Whatever you do
Whatever you do
Don't wake me up

Oeh
Make the moment last forever
Oeh
All the voices sing together
This is what my dreams are made of
Oeh
So whatever you do, don't wake me up




 What if I would be the only one
What if I could give you all I’ve got
Everything inside me says to run
So what if I would be
Everything I touch looks like gold
But somehow turns to ashes
Every time I love it’s hard to hold
It always burns and crashes
So, oh, oh
I will never know
'Cause every time I love, I let it go
If you want to wait
It’s fine with me
But I won’t be here in the end, I know
This was really never up to me
If it’s love, let go
Everything I touch looks like gold
But somehow turns to ashes
Every time I love it’s hard to hold
It always burns and crashes
So, oh, oh
I will never know
'Cause every time I love, I let it go
Everything I touch looks like gold
But somehow turns to ashes
Every time I love it’s hard to hold
It always burns and crashes
So, oh, oh
I will never know
So, oh, oh
I will never know
'Cause every time I love, I let it go




 Every time I see you
The border slips away
The line moves further
Another language
Your face is fading today

I can't see you now
Can't see you now

And the best time must come yet
I'll never forget that you'll take me away from here
And the best time must come yet
I'll never forget that you'll take me away
But it's all in me

Every time I want you
The clouds are getting darker
The shade watches over me
I can't wait to leave this place to go to you
And just embrace the times you're with me

I can't see you now
Can't see you now

And the best time must come yet
I'll never forget that you'll take me away from here
And the best time must come yet
I'll never forget that you'll take me away
But it's all in me

And the best time must come yet
I'll never forget that you'll take me away from here
And the best time must come yet
I'll never forget you
You
You

You
You
You

But it's all in
Yeah it's all in
Yeah it's all in, in me




 I give away all my thoughts now
I give away all the pain
To be more than just a person
I have to tell everyone

And I feel so much better
I can feel everything
This is all that matters
I can feel everything

I know what people are thinking
But most of them don't know
What it's like to lose you
To them it's just one big show

But I feel so much better
I can feel everything
This is all that matters
I can feel everything

And I feel so much better
I can feel everything
This is all that matters
I can feel everything

Feel
I can feel
I can feel
I can feel everything

I give away all my thoughts now
I give away all the pain
To be more than just a person
I have to tell everyone




 I'm feeling lost standing still
My back against the wall
We've built it up over time
I don't know who you are
I'm tired of holding it up
I've got to watch it fall
Run away, find a way without you

I know you want me to fight
I know you want me to try
I know you want me to care about you
But I can't fight anymore
I've tried for so long
It's hard to care when it's gone
I'm giving up on you
I'm giving up on you

It's not that I don't, or I've never felt
It's just that you taught me how to live without
I'm not afraid to face it all by myself
Run away, find a way without you

I know you want me to fight
I know you want me to try
I know you want me to care about you

 Don't you, don't you worry about it baby
Cause I got it all figured out, don't worry about a thing
I say come on, come and see what I've got waiting
Cause tonight can be whatever and everything we want

[Chorus]
Baby let's tear it up
Watch it all burning down
Maybe it's not enough
And I don't care who's around
We can just make it happen, make it happen here right now

Let's get ooooohhhh....
If you'r with me baby we're good to go
I said oooohhhh... can another dream baby look at me
I said oooohhhh... good to go

So, let's keep on keep it going till it's all gone
We don't need to try tonight we'll find you tomorrow on it's own

[Chorus]
Now... now...
Let's get ooooohhhh....
If you'r with me baby we're good to go
I said oooohhhh... can another dream baby look at me
Cause it's you and me it's all we need
So let's do it up and do it recklessly
I said ooohhh... good to go

Good to go
Good to go
Good to go

Let's get ooooohhhh....
If you'r with me baby we're good to go
I said oooohhhh... can another dream look at me

 When
The dark
Is creeping op on us to fast
When
You start
Thinking it will never past
Then tomorrow will find us where we, all get lost some times
Who oh oh oh oh
Who oh oh oh oh
Who oh oh oh oh

And we
Are okay tonight
Who oh oh oh oh
Who oh oh oh oh
Who oh oh oh oh

Going under
We're drowning with the heavy heart
Makes, us wonder how we even come this far
But tomorrow will find us where we, all get lost some times
Who oh oh oh oh
Who oh oh oh oh
Who oh oh oh oh

And we
Are okay tonight
Who oh oh oh oh
Who oh oh oh oh
Who oh oh oh oh

Oh

And we, all get lost some times
Who oh oh oh oh
Who oh oh oh oh
Who oh oh oh oh

And we
Are okay tonight
Who oh oh oh oh
Who oh oh oh oh
Who oh oh oh oh
Who oh oh oh oh
Who oh oh oh oh
Who oh oh oh oh
Who oh oh oh oh
Who oh oh oh oh
Who oh oh oh oh




 Out in the cold
I'm going back where I belong
You should have told me
That your heart was made of stone

As I try to look back to those moments we had
But still I walk through this door without you

I'm out in the rain
You're there in the sunshine
But you keep calling, you keep begging me for more
And now you know how I feel, now you know all my pain
But I still stand here
Still stand here without you

I'm stuck in a place
I see a crowd with just one face
You still haunt me
You're a memory I can't erase

As I try to look back to those moments we had
But still I walk through this door without you

I'm out in the rain
You're there in the sunshine
But you keep calling, you keep begging me for more
And now you know how I feel, now you know all my pain
But I still stand here
Still stand here without you
But I still stand here
Still stand here without you

I keep on searching, I'll find a cure
Do things I wanna do and more
I live in a place where the air is pure
But I keep on wondering if you wanted more

I keep on searching, I'll find a cure
Do things I wanna do and more
I keep on wondering why I'm lost without you

I'm out in the rain
You're there in the sunshine
But you keep calling, you keep begging me for more
I'm out in the rain
You're there in the sunshine
But you keep calling, you keep begging me for more

And now you know how I feel
Now you know all my pain
But I still stand here
Still stand here without you

And now you know how I feel
Now you know all my pain
But I still stand here
Still stand here without you
But I still stand here
Still stand here without you

I'm out in the rain




 En ineens zag ik je lopen
En ik dacht
Hoe-oe, Hoe-oe
Ik was meteen ondersteboven
En jij om de
Hoe-oek, hoe-oek
En we liepen samen verder
En ik dacht
Hoe-oe, Hoe-oe
Passen wij ineens zo
Goe-oed, goe-oed
Bij elkaar en ik weet niet wat ik
Doe-oe, doe-oe
Hoe zijn we hier beland
Hoe-oe, Hoe-oe

En we vliegen door de dagen
En het voelt
Goe-oe, oe-oed
En ik moet het eigenlijk niet vragen
Maar wat nou als ik het
Doe-oe doe-oe
Wil je samen verder
En ik dacht
Hoe-oe, Hoe-oe
Passen wij ineens zo
Goe-oed, goe-oed
Bij elkaar en ik weet niet wat ik
Doe-oe, doe-oe
Hoe zijn we hier beland
Hoe-oe, Hoe-oe

Hoe-oe, Hoe-oe
Passen wij ineens zo
Goehoed, goehoed
Bij elkaar en ik weet niet wat ik
Doe-oe, doe-oe
Hoe zijn we hier beland
Hoe-oe, Hoe-oe

En ik dacht
Hoe-oe, Hoe-oe
Passen wij ineens zo
Goe-oed, goe-oed
Bij elkaar en ik weet niet wat ik
Doe-oe, doe-oe
Hoe zijn we hier beland
Hoe-oe, Hoe-oe




 Ooh
Ooh
From the house upon the hill
All is still
In this battle of Wills

Cause you don't know how it feels
Upon this fairest hail
This trip isn't real

And we'll never forget who we are
Old tattoos and battle scars
Still have a heart that sometimes breaks
Still have a mind that lies awake

Still and up six feet underground
Still the same world spinning now
I watch it al as I stand still
From the house, the house upon the hill

Ooh
Ooh

Like a star upon a tree
That's who we'll be
On new year streets

When I fall, I fall so hard
Like al good shooting stars
That make it this far

And we'll never forget who we are
Old tattoos and battle scars
Still have a heart that sometimes breaks
Still have a mind that lies awake

Still and up six feet underground
Still the same world spinning now
I watch it al as I stand still
From the house, the house upon the hill

Ooh
Ooh

Don't take it all away
No you can't take it all away
The way I was is still my way
And it's not that long since yesterday

And we'll never forget who we are
Old tattoos and battle scars
Still have a heart that sometimes breaks
Still have a mind that lies awake
Still and up six feet underground
Still the same world spinning now
I watch it all as I stand still
From the house, the house upon the hill




 Bless your heart
Searching tonight
Wait till the sun goes down
Coming alive
Up from the underground
Never alone
Silent, don’t make a sound
'Cause I’m searching tonight
I'll follow you in the dark
You have a fragile heart
Mine is a hunter
I’ll find you where you are
And take you under
I’ll break you at the start
No love, no wonder
You are a fragile heart
I am hunter
Hunter
You’re not the first
And yet will be more to come
It’s gonna hurt
If you think you’re my only one
The thrill of the chase
Hungry just like the wolf
There’s no escape
I'll follow you in the dark
You have a fragile heart
Mine is a hunter
I’ll find you where you are
And take you under
I’ll break you at the start
No love, no wonder
You are a fragile heart
I am hunter
Hunter
I am hunter
Hunter
You have a fragile heart
Mine is a hunter
I’ll find you where you are
And take you under
I’ll break you at the start
No love, no wonder
You are a fragile heart
I am hunter
Hunter
I am hunter
I am hunter
Hunter




 I, I wanted you to know
I can let it show
I’m paying for my days without you, oh, oh
And I looked as if I was hurt
I went away with big wet tears you made

I do what I do
I do what I please
I take all your money
And then I will leave
I do what I do
I do what I please
I take all your money
And then I will leave
I’ll spend all your money
I’ll give it away for love

I have done so many things
Coloured by the poor and rich
I’ve been losing me one love
I know better, life’s better
This way

And now, now that it’s all gone
I can go back home
Without trouble, thinking you are there
When I was twenty-two
I was following you
It lead me nowhere

I do what I do
I do what I please
I take all your money
And than I will leave
I do what I do
I do what I please
I take all your money
And than I will leave
I’ll give it away
I’ll give it away for love

I have done so many things
Coloured by the poor and rich
I’ve been losing my one love
I know better, life’s better
This way
This way
This way

I do what I do
I do what I please
I take all your money
And than I will leave
I do what I do
I do what I please
I take all your money
And than I will leave

I have done so many things
Coloured by the poor and rich
I’ve been losing my one love
I know better, life’s better

I have done so many things
Coloured by the poor and rich
I’ve been losing my one love
I know better, life’s better
This way




 I know I will be fine this year
I’ve lost all my senses and all my tears
I traded it for something new
Something without you
I know I will be fine this year
We gave it a little too much too soon
And now there’s nothing that I fear
So here’s a whole new tune
It’s you
It’s you
All I know is that it’s something new
I came this far with all I knew
All I knew
I know I will be fine this year
The seasons have changed, but I’m still here
I’m stronger than I've ever been
The pain, the loss I felt within
It’s you
It’s you
All I know is that it’s something new
I came this far with all I knew
It’s you
It’s you
And all I know is that it’s something new
I came this far with all I knew
I know I will be fine this year
We gave it a little too much too soon
The seasons changed, but I’m still here
I came this far with all I knew
It’s you
It’s you
It’s you
I’m stronger than before
I know I will be fine this year




 Alles verandert...altijd
Ik ben er klaar voor...bereid
Om het te geven.. aan jou
Zal ik me laten leiden door wat ik vertrouw?
Tot onze wegen straks weer zullen scheiden
Binnenstebuiten gekeerd..
Ik was het fluiten verleerd...
Zal ik me laten leiden door wat ik vertrouw?
Tot onze wegen straks weer zullen scheiden...
En het kan me niet veel schelen waar en hoe....
En het maakt niet uit hoe lang en waar naartoe...
Zolang ik maar zelf mag weten wat ik doe...
Want ik zoek alleen mezelf...
Waar we ook lopen vandaag...
Ik sta weer open en vraag:
Zal ik me laten leiden door wat ik vertrouw?
Tot onze wegen straks weer zullen scheiden...
En het kan me niet veel schelen waar en hoe....
En het maakt niet uit hoe lang en waar naartoe...
Zolang ik maar zelf mag weten wat ik doe...
Want ik zoek alleen mezelf...
En het maakt niet uit hoe lang en waar naartoe...
Alles verandert...altijd...
Ik ben er klaar voor...bereid...




 I only live with true love easy days, the usual usual stuff
Everyday I lie to myself of course I'm in love

No one has called my name yet so
Goodbye for you then and I'm all alone

Please give me a safe spot something to hide in
I'm going nowhere now
I wanna follow my heart, why don't you follow my heart now
It's going nowhere

I'm in the middle of nothing right now
The things that were meant for me mean nothing
At night I just want to talk to myself

You
You

You wanted more than I could give you that is why we broke up
Now I'm sleeping with lies and guys
I've lost my lust for love

No one has called my name yet so
Goodbye for you then and I'm all alone

Please give me a safe spot something to hide in
I'm going nowhere now
I wanna follow my heart, why don't you follow my heart now
It's going nowhere

I'm in the middle of nothing right now
The things that were ment for me mean nothing
At night I just want to talk to myself

What do you see, I'm standing right here in front of you
Every time you tell me that I'm not the one
I'm not the one for

You
You

Please give me a safe spot something to hide in
I'm going nowher now
I wanna follow my heart, why don't you follow my heart now
It's going nowhere

Stuck in the middle of nothing right now
The things that were meant for me mean nothing
At night I just want to talk to myself

Talk to myself

I'm in the middle of nothing right now
The thing that were meant for me mean nothing
At night I just want to talk to myself

Talk to myself
Talk to myself 'round here




 I get stuck on finding words
My heartbeat won't let them out
It's always so much work
Whenever you are around
I keep cool but it's showing through
These feelings I'm feeling for you
Are too much they're starting to show
I need you to know
Ooh, you make me completely irrational
And it feels insanely so natural
Like falling hard
And never landing
Right from the start
Don't understand it
You make me completely irrational
I just want you on my skin
And under my heavy heart
I wanna let you in
Every way and every part
I keep cool but it's showing through
These feelings I'm feeling for you
Are too much they're starting to show
I need you to know
Ooh, you make me completely irrational
And it feels insanely so natural
Like falling hard
And never landing
Right from the start
Don't understand it
You make me completely irrational
Oh, ooooh, oh, ooh
You make me completely irrational
And it feels insanely so natural
Like falling hard
And never landing
Right from the start
Don't understand it
You make mu completely irrational




 I want to be happy, but I just can't
The things that we're having now, I don't understand
How could this happen so fast, I'm not used to that
Thet things I like and the things that you do right now
Are just not the same and I wonder how
If this is my fault or not, I'm so lost
The time keeps ticking and nobody needs me
I think about the words that seemed so serious
I lied to you but I know better now
Oh, oh, oh
I want to do something good, something good for you
'cause I don't know how to say that I love you too
So everything turns out the wrong way
Oh, oh, oh
Now I'm at home all alone, and you're away
I always thought that we, that we would stay

I lied to you but I know better now
Oh, oh, oh
I want to do something good, something good for you
'cause I don't know how to say that I love you too
So everything turns out the wrong way
Oh, oh, oh
I want to do something good, something good for you
'cause I don't know how to say that I love you too
So everything turns out the wrong way
Oh, oh, oh
I want to do something good, something good for you
'cause I don't know how to say that I love you too
So everything turns out the wrong way
Oh, oh, oh
I want to do something good, something good for you
'cause I don't know how to say, that I love you too
So everthing turns out the wrong way
Oh, oh, oh




 I met you in a bar
I never thought it would come this far
Patience is a thing I like
That's why I turn my back on you

You do that too

Yes it's so scary to fall in love
When you don't know someone that well
Could you fall for me forever?
Don't you turn your back on me?
I am falling in love with you anyway

Last time that I saw you
We were sober didn't have anything to talk about
We got ourselves a beer or two
And than it came all out
You liked me too

Yes it's so scary to fall in love
When you don't know someone that well
Could you fall for me forever?
Don't you turn your back on me?
I am falling in love with you anyway

When the alcohol is running though our vains
We order one more drink and than the love remains
So it's slibslabbertyslob that I say
I love you but we both know that's not true

So scary to fall in love
When you don't know someone that well
Could you fall for me forever?
Don't you turn you back on...

So scary to fall in love
When you don't know someone that well
Could you fall for me forever?
Don't you turn you back on me?
I am falling in love with you
You were just a flirt
You were an asshole anyway




 We could bring this home and let it rest
We could use the space and catch our breath
Maybe it’s me, and maybe it’s you
Maybe it’s time, let’s follow it through
Just for today
Can we try to be here in this moment?
Just for today
Can we forget everything we have said and done?
Just for today
Can we lose sight of where this is going?
Don’t worry about what we are feeling
The morning and the dreaming
The future 'cause tomorrow can wait
Just for today
We could leave it all here where it is
The sound will catch the broken parts we miss
Can you hear it, my heart speaks?
Just for today
Can we try to be here in this moment?
Just for today
Can we forget everything we have said and done?
Just for today
Can we lose sight of where this is going?
Don’t worry about what we are feeling
The morning and the dreaming
The future 'cause tomorrow can wait
Just for today
Just for today
Can we try to be here in this moment?
Just for today
Can we forget everything we have said and done?
Just for today
Can we lose sight of where this is going?
Don’t worry about what we are feeling
The morning and the dreaming
The future 'cause tomorrow can wait
Just for today




 Zoveel meegemaakt
De wereld onder je voeten vandaan
Verslagen, verloren en alleen
Maar familie om je heen
Allemaal bij elkaar
Hand in hand in deze moeilijke tijden
Iemand verloren maar nog altijd kun je hem horen
Tranen laten lopen maar altijd blijven hopen
Je vader verloren maar nog altijd zal hij je horen
Een lach op zijn gezicht want een kleintje is in zicht
Een lach op zijn gezicht want een kleintje in zicht
Overal voorgaan, dat is hoe jullie in het leven staan
Vechtend, genietend elke dag
Want iemand verloren maar nog altijd kun je hem horen
Tranen laten lopen maar altijd blijven hopen
Je vader verloren maar nog altijd kan hij je horen
Een lach op zijn gezicht want een kleintje is in zicht
Een lach op zijn gezicht want een kleintje is in zicht
Een lach op jullie gezicht want een nieuw leven is in zicht




 Who will wait for me?
The lies are picking up
Bonding people on a leach
Danger inside
The heart cries, the mind dies
The lost and betrayal
Forever in their hearts
The mind sets
The rain starts to fall
If I wanted to leave
If I wanted to breathe
If I would I’d be lost inside your heart
If I wanted to see
If I wanted to feel
If I would I’d be lost inside
And now the mind keeps changing
The lies keeps shaking
The world turns every day
And now my mind keeps wondering
The lies get weaker
It’s taking the star away
Trust and blind are the same
It’s all in the game
Pushing people to something
They don’t even
The heart cries, the mind dies
The lost and betrayal
Forever in their hearts
The mind sets
The rain starts to fall
If I wanted to leave
If I wanted to breathe
If I would I’d be lost inside your heart
If I wanted to see
If I wanted to feel
If I would I’d be lost
And now the world keeps changing
The mind keeps fading
The long gets every day
And now my world gets weaker
The mind gets sleezer
You know it’s taking away
You know my world keeps changing
The lie keeps fading
It’s taking believe away
You know my world keeps changing the lies
It’s taking believe away




 [Verse 1: Miss Montreal]
Can't keep wearing my heart on my sleeve
Can't keep saying just what I feel
Why do words on my tongue run free? Keep tripping me
Can't keep wearing my heart on my sleeve

[Verse 2: Miss Montreal]
I can't keep wearing the truth in my eyes
Oh it's not that I want them to lie
I've been told it's the best of advice in this life
Can't keep wearing the truth in my eyes

[Pre-Chorus: Miss Montreal]
But suddenly the words drop out
I'm naked as can be
Try to stop them but I don't know
How, how, how, how
It's written all over my face
And everyone can see
I guess you finally know I love you now

[Chorus: Miss Montreal]
Love you now
Love you now
I guess you finally know I love you now

[Verse 3: Miss Montreal]
I keep hearing I'm an open book
Where the ending is known with one look
A heart in love doesn't ever do what it should
I keep hearing I'm an open book

[Pre-Chorus: Miss Montreal]
But suddenly the words drop out
I'm naked as can be
Try to stop them but I don't know
How, how, how, how
It's written all over my face
And everyone can see
I guess you finally know I love you now

[Chorus: Miss Montreal]
Love you now
Love you now
I guess you finally know I love you now
Love you now
Love you now
I guess you finally know I love you now

[Bridge: Miss Montreal]
I love you now
I love you
I love you

[Outro: Miss Montreal]
Love you now
Love you now
I guess you finally know I love you now
Love you now
Love you now
I guess you finally know I love you now
Love you now (I love you)
Love you now (I love you)
I guess you finally know I love you now
Love you now (I love you)
Love you now (I love you)
I guess you finally know I love you now




 Gouden haren, groene ogen
Geboren en getogen in het oosten
Ik ben een boerin
Een cadeautje gekregen
Want ik stotter door het leven
Ik zzzzit er lekker in
Als ik rook kijk ik scheel
En vaak drink ik te veel
Maar ik weet wat ik wil
Want ik bbbben het meisje
Van het oosten
Er is niks aan mij gelogen
Ik ben het meisje van het oosten
Zie me rappen en flowen
Ik ben de shit
Kijk mezelf diep in de ogen
Kon er vroeger alleen op hopen
Kan nog steeds niet echt geloven dat ik hier nu zit
Als ik rook kijk ik scheel
En vaak drink ik te veel
Maar ik weet wat ik wil
Want ik bbbben het meisje
Van het oosten




 So The last that ever she saw him
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
He passed on worried and warning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Lost in a riddle that Saturday night
Far away on the other side
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
And she couldn't find how to push through
The trees that whisper in the evening
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun
Far away on the other side
He was shot six times by a man on the run
And she couldn't find how to push through
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven far away
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven one day
Four A.M. in the morning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
I watched your vision forming
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Stars roll slowly in a silvery night
Far away on the other side
Will you come to terms with me this night
But she couldn't find how to push through
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven far away
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven one day
Far away on the other side
Caught in the middle of a hundred and five
The night was heavy and the air was alive
But she couldn't find how to push through
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Far away on the other side
But she couldn't find how to push through




 The world could end
But you can't leave, you can't leave
And even if it were to start again

You can't leave, you can't leave
I have never felt so sure or felt like this before, never had it all
You took me trough the pain, brought me back again
You can't leave
Don't tell me there's fucking nothing left to say
How can you look away now
We came way too far to take it all away
No one's gonna love you more
Don't you look away now
Don't tell me there's fucking nothing left to say
Even if there's nothing left to say
You're halfway gone
But you can't leave, you can't leave
Until you tell me what went wrong
But you can't leave, you can't leave
I have never felt so sure or felt like this before, never had it all
You took me trough the pain, brought me back again
You can't leave
Don't tell me there's fucking nothing left to say
How can you look away now
We came way too far to take it all away
No one's gonna love you more
Don't you look away now
Don't tell me there is fucking nothing left to say
Even if there's nothing left to say
Still looking for the words to make you stay
Don't tell me there's fucking nothing left to say
How can you look away now
We came way too far to take it all away
No one's gonna love you more
Don't you look away now
Don't tell me there is fucking nothing left to say
Even if there's nothing left to say




 [Verse 1]
I could stand in front of 10,000 people
Sing my heart out and still feel so peaceful
But when I look at you, I don't think I do
My heart beats faster than aeroplanes
Thinking that you could feel the same
Cause when I look at you, I definitely do, definitely do

[Pre-Chorus]
The words are frozen on the floor
Barman please pour me one more

[Chorus]
One last drink for the road
One last drink for the road
I got you ringing in my head
Ringing in my head, ringing in my head
One last drink for the road
One more minute to go
I got you ringing in my head
Ringing in my head, ringing in my head

[Verse 2]
I've found three words at the bottom of a bottle
And if you wanna hear them just pour me a double
Cause when I look at you, I definitely do, definitely do

[Pre-Chorus]
The words are frozen on the floor
I pick them up and drink some more

[Chorus]
One last drink for the road
One last drink for the road
I got you ringing in my head
Ringing in my head, ringing in my head
One last drink for the road
One more minute to go
I got you ringing in my head
Ringing in my head, ringing in my head

[Bridge]
I'm so drunk, I'm so drunk on you, you
I'm so drunk, I'm so drunk on you, you
I'm so drunk, I'm so drunk on you, you
I'm so drunk, I'm so drunk on you, you

[Chorus]
One last drink for the road
One last drink for the road
I got you ringing in my head
Ringing in my head, ringing in my head
One last drink for the road
One more minute to go
I got you ringing in my head
Ringing in my head, ringing in my head

One last drink for the road
One more minute to go
I got you ringing in my head
Ringing in my head, ringing in my head
One last drink for the road
One more minute to go
I got you ringing in my head
Ringing in my head, ringing in my head




 Would you come for me if you could
You are there and I am here alone
We don't know what to wait for
Two strangers with no home
Do you feel me, can you hear me?
Would you be there if I called your name?
Can not stand the feeling
That you'll never understand

I see the way you look at me, it makes me angry
I don't know if you'll ever know me at all

Don't ask for deeper thoughts
They'll only break us further down
And there is nobody else around
I miss you more each day I'm alone

'Cause you
You don't know me

Do you see me, do you read me?
Well my thoughts are like an open book
It's somewhere in between the lines
So take a closer look

I see the way you look at me, it makes me angry
I don't know if you'll ever know me at all

Don't ask for deeper thoughts
They'll only break us further down
And there is nobody else around
I miss you more each day I'm alone

Can my heart reach you from here
It is screaming and I
I wonder
If you can hear
Can hear me

'Cause you
You don't know me

Don't ask for deeper thoughts
They'll only break us further down
And there is nobody else around
I miss you more each day I'm lone

'Cause you
'Cause you
You don't know me

'Cause you
'Cause you
You don't know me
You don't know me at all




 It's time to say goodbye
It's time to go away
Forever? Not anymore
Seeking what you want
Breaking out a cell
Forever? Not anymore

And I am wondering how you feel
Getting it for real
Searching everything
Doing as I can
Sacrificing everything
But I still love you anyway

Every day I wonder how you can live your life
How you can believe that you're doing alright
The path that you follow
The words that you hide
I see from a distance the look in your eyes
You're pushing me away now
You want to be alone now
Won't't let me in now

And I am wondering how you feel
Getting it for real
Searching everything
Doing as I can
Sacrificing everything
But I still love you anyway

It's time to go away
To a place where we can stay
Everlasting love
Forever anymore
Just open up that door
Seek and you will find

This is me she said
This is me she said
This is me
This is me
This is me

Spend to much time with each other but we did'nt build and

 Oh
Trading the last stuff for dimes
For cigarettes and alcohol
She hands it all out to the guys
Wondering where to find a home

She's singing oh, oh (oh)

Dance around and wasting time
Too young for tomorrow
She said so loud the world on fire
Drunk driving a limbo

She's singing oh, oh (oh)

Say heaven, heaven, heaven
When all you know is hell, hell, hell
Wherever we are
Let's make a story to tell (oh, oh)
Say heaven, heaven, heaven
When all you know is hell, hell, hell
Wherever we are
Let's make a story to tell (oh, oh)

She never wrote the book all night
But she's made it a couple times
So good out the sun is on
Never needed anyone

She's singing oh, oh (oh)

Say heaven, heaven, heaven
When all you know is hell, hell, hell
Wherever we are
Let's make a story to tell (oh, oh)
Say heaven, heaven, heaven
When all you know is hell, hell, hell
Wherever we are
Let's make a story

When money won't buy you
Everything soaking you to the skin
When waters run dry well
Say heaven
Or say hell
Uuoh

Say heaven, heaven, heaven
When all you know is hell, hell, hell
Wherever we are
Let's make a story to tell (oh, oh)
Say heaven, heaven, heaven
When all you know is hell, hell, hell
Wherever we are
Let's make a story to tell




 Sittin' around in a small town
Where no one knows their way out
But you keep holdin' on
Running away for the last time
But you keep saying the last time
Would be the last one
Don't go wasting
These times you're facing
I know you've been there
Say what you see and don't wast you're time
I didn't mean to let you fall down
From the battles of my mind
Time will display all the feelings left behind
I didn't see that you and I
It's fucked up how I'm missing you every day
I'm making it right for the first time
But all I ever find in this town is a smile on a broken face
I want you to see I've been lost inside
I'm trailing my mind
But I always find that these feelings I can't replace
So don't go wasting
These times you're facing
I know you've been there
Say what you see and don't wast you're time
I didn't mean to let you fall down
From the battles of my mind
Time will display all the feelings left behind
I didn't see that you and I

I hold back all the feelings that I wanna say
It's not good but I'm feeling them anyway
I took for granted everything I ever loved
I hold back all the feelings that I wanna say
It's not good but I'm feeling them anyway
I took for granted everything I ever loved
Woah woah
Woah woah
Woah woah
Woah woah
Say what you see and don't wast you're time
I didn't mean to let you fall down
From the battles of my mind
Time will display all the feelings left behind
I didn't see that you and I
It's fucked up how I'm missing you every day
Say what you see and don't wast you're time
I didn't mean to let you fall down
From the battles of my mind
Time will display all the feelings left behind
I didn't see that you and I
It's fucked up how I'm missing you every day
Say what you see and don't wast you're time
I didn't mean to let you fall down
From the battles of my mind
Time will display all the feelings left behind
I didn't see that you and I
It's fucked up how I'm missing you every day




 A week has seven days so you need seven friends
You tell where it starts and whenever it ends
You better find them now before it's too late

You can't buy me love, that is what they say
Well, I bought it seven times, didn't have to pay
Went back for seven more but now it's too late

One's in the middle on four and the other's on five
I hope I have seven friends left on the day that I die
So I say, big, big, little more time in the middle
Buy, break everything back into my riddle
You need seven friends to do whatever you like
Whatever you like

If you had a crappy life, had nothing to do
I hope your friends will go to heaven with you
You better find them now before it's too late

You can call me names or whatever you want to
I would do nothing with or without you
I would make another day and now it's too late

One's in the middle on four and the other's on five
I hope I have seven friends left on the day that I die
So I say, big, big, little more time in the middle
Buy, break everything back into my riddle
You need seven friends to do whatever you like

Whatever you like (buy break seven days, buy break seven friends)
One's in the middle on four and the other's on five
I hope I have seven friends left on the day that I die

One's in the middle on four and the other's on five
I hope I have seven friends left on the day that I die
So I say, big, big, little more time in the middle
Buy, break everything back into my riddle
You need seven friends to do whatever you like




 Cold, I wonder how the world would look like with your light
Darkness keeps me away from getting in your sight
It changes all the things that I believe
Being without you, without you is no relief
I am so cold
I’m so cold
I’m so cold without you
I am so low
I’m so low
I feel the emptiness inside
And I wonder how it will be
Without all my love I saved for you
I am so cold
I’m so cold
I’m so cold without you
Sold, I sold my heart to you and never got it back
Now I’m walking with a hole and without you
I’ll keep on walking till I find something new, new
I’ll keep on walking, walking, walking
I am so cold
I’m so cold
I’m so cold without you
I am so low
I’m so low
I feel the emptiness inside
And I wonder how it will be
Without all my love I saved for you
I am so cold
I’m so cold
I’m so cold without you
I am so low
I’m so low
I feel the emptiness inside
And I wonder how it will be
Without all my love I saved for you
I am so cold
I’m so cold
I’m so cold without you




 You're waking up now, to see it all much clearer
It's over your head now
Just walk when I give you all my fears and

It's over gone, you're back on the ground

So this is home, so this is home
It's so much easier when you're on your own
So this is home, so this is home
It's so much easier when you're all alone

You're coming home

You're doing fine now, but is it really worth it
When it's all safe and sound
You know it all so why don't you just go break this

It's over gone, you're back on the ground

So this is home, so this is home
It's so much easier when you're on your own
So this is home, so this is home
It's so much easier when your all alone

You're coming home

Stronger, faster, better, more than you expected
Take it easy, take it easy
Don't do things that you just might regret someday
Take it easy, you don't need me

So this is home, so this is home
It's so much easier when you're on your own
So this is home, so this is home
It's so much easier when you're on your own
So this is home, so this is home
It's so much easier when your all alone

You're coming home




 Who will wait for me forever in a fight
Bonding people on a leash
Danger inside
The heart cries
The mind dies
The loss in betrayal
Forever and there are hearts
The tears break
The rain starts to fall

The thoughts will hold her
The love gets older
The mind sets everyday
You know my lies get weaker
The storm will sink her
It's taking belief away

Trust and blood are the same
It's all in the game
Pushing people to something
They don't even

The heart cries
The mind dies
The loss in betrayal
Forever and there are hearts
The tears break
The rain starts to fall

If I wanted to leave
If I wanted to breathe
If I would I'd be lost inside your heart
I've got nothing to give
Nothing more to forget
In the danger of m...

The thoughts will hold her
The love gets older
The mind sets everyday
You know the lies get weaker
The storm will sink her
It's taking belief away




 Something's changing, it's taking over
The dark light in this night

We will sneak out, through the backdoor
Dance like we never did before
And then a little more, more, more
Till our body's begging
Begging for some sleep, but we
But we won't, we will, we will swing the night away
We'll swing the night away

A small step, a big smile, is all we ever need in these times
If you go, I will follow

We will sneak out, through the backdoor
Dance like we never did before
And then a little more, more, more
Till our body's begging
Begging for some sleep, but we
But we won't, we will, we will swing the night away
We'll swing the night away

1, 2, 3 I'm counting all the nights that we
That we had to miss this kiss
Yes miss this kiss of you and me, you and me

We will sneak out, through the backdoor
Dance like we never did before
And then a little more, more, more

We will sneak out, through the backdoor
Dance like we never did before
And then a little more, more, more

We will sneak out, through the backdoor
Dance like we never did before
And then a little more, more, more
Till our body's begging
Begging for some sleep, but we
But we won't, we will, we will swing the night away
We'll swing the night away




 Thank you for being there
Thank you for brushing my hair
Thank you for teaching me life is'nt fair
And showing me how to care
Thank you for picking me up
When as usual will fucked it up
Thank you for telling me all my mistakes
For lessons the life sometimes makes

And before it gets too late
And the moment slips away
Until my final days
Thank you is all I can say

Sorry that i stayed out late
And all the nights you stayed awake
But I'm thirty-one and I still haven't learn
But one day the tables will turn

And before it gets too late
And the moment slips away
Untill my final days
Thank you is all I can say

[Bridge]
And before it gets too late
And the moment slips away
Until my final days
Thank you is all I can say

Thank you for leading the way
Thank you is all that i wanted to say

 This is what it means to love me
It comes with highs and lows
In the darkness you can see
There's a light for you and me
And no I never means to hurt you
I never wants you bring me down
Yes I hate the way we fight
When I'm up with you all night

So come back down
Till the moment we have found
That is worth the while

This is what it means to love me
This is what it means to understand
When I get up with you all night
But I feel down by morninglight
And tell me what it means to love you
Tell me what it is you really need
I can wake up with you all night
I can wake up till this feels right

No nothing matters more than this my love
So tell me what it means to love you
Tell me what it is you really need
Where it is your feelings hide and the dark come on your side

So come back down
Till the moment we have found that is worth the while

This is what it means to love me
This is what it means to understand
When I get up with you all night
And I feel down by morning light
And tell me what it means to love you
Tell me what it is you really need
I can wake up with you all night
I can wake up till this feels right

No nothing matters more than this my love
It's time start the healing
I can bare the float of living
When the whole world falls to pieces
There's just one thing I'm feeling
I'm with you

This is what it means to love me
This is what it means to understand
When I get up with you all night
And I feel down by morning light
So tell me what it means to love you
Tell me what it is you really need
I can wake up with you all night
I can wake up till this feels right

No nothing matters 
Nothing matters more than
Nothing matters more than you my love




 Many years have passed since we met in a song
An introduction that slapped me in the face quite hard
Many drinks and so much wiser I am now
Let me tell you that your music and I had a ball

Now it's time for me to give you something back
So I'll sing like you did then and hope you're thankfull for that

This one's for you
This one's for you
This one's for you alright

This one's for you
This one's for you
This one's for you alright now now

Now you're living on a farm and God knows where
What do you do, do you remember who I am
The possibility to thank you in this song
Is the best way I could ever think of

Now it's time for me to give you something back
So I'll sing like you did then and hope you're thankfull for that

This one's for you
This one's for you
This one's for you alright

This one's for you
This one's for you
This one's for you alright now now

This one's for you
This one's for you
This one's for you alright

This one's for you
This one's for you
This one's for you alright now now now now

This one's for you [6x]




 Tic toc the clock strikes one
Heaven is for everyone
Can u feel the waters rushing in
How do I get back in time
Get back just to take you mine
How do I pretend that I don't care

I paint a picture colored in grey
Try to remember but memories fade
Tic toc the clock strikes one
Heaven is for everyone
Can you feel the waters rushing in

Like a bullet from a gun
Seems my ours on the run
Try to put it back together
But it's tic toc forever
I'm a warrior in the night
But its shadows from the light
Need to get myself together but it's tic toc forever

Tic toc the clock strikes two
Heaven is for me and you
Now I'm outside starin'at the door
How can I get back the past
Some good things ain't meant to last
Holding me in silent till they're gone
I paint a picture colored in grey
Try to remember but memories fade

Like a bullet from a gun
Seems my ours on the run
Try to put it back together
But it's tic toc forever
I'm a warrior in the night
But its shadows from the light
Need to get myself together but it's tic toc forever

But it's tic toc forever
Need to get myself together but it's tic toc forever

Like a bullet from a gun
Seems my ours on the run
Try to put it back together
But it's tic toc forever
I'm a warrior in the night
But its shadows from the light
Need to get myself together but it's tic toc forever

Tic toc the clock strikes one
Heaven is for everyone
Can you feel the waters rushing in




 [Verse 1]
Wat een jongen kan meemaken en toch zo blijft staan
Het is moeilijk om te weten dat je ooit weg zult gaan
Je stond hier voor de brievenbus met een groot gebaar
Domien die voelde tranen en dat bracht Nederland bij elkaar

[Chorus]
Je bent een voorbeeld voor ons allemaal
Je bent een held, een jongen
En een eeuwig mooi verhaal
Je bent een voorbeeld voor ons allemaal
Je bent een held, een jongen
Je bent een eeuwig mooi verhaal

[Verse 2]
Wat jij hebt gedaan met jouw zijn deze week
Doet niemand jou na
Maar door jou lijkt het simpel
En doet iedereen jou na

[Chorus]
Je bent een voorbeeld voor ons allemaal
Je bent een held, een jongen
En een eeuwig mooi verhaal
Je bent een voorbeeld voor ons allemaal
Je bent een held, een jongen
Je bent een eeuwig mooi verhaal

[Verse 3]
Je leert deze wereld pas kennen
Nog zoveel te doen en te zien
Ik hoop dat jij geniet van alles
Ook al duurt het niet lang misschien

[Chorus]
Je bent een voorbeeld voor ons allemaal
Je bent een held, een jongen
En een eeuwig mooi verhaal
Je bent een voorbeeld voor ons allemaal
Je bent een held, een jongen
Je bent een eeuwig mooi verhaal
Je bent een held, een jongen
En jij bent Tijn met jouw verhaal




 [Verse 1]
I let my heart dive in the ocean
I found myself a better place (ooh)
And I got lost in my devotion
Hoping for brighter days
Gone with the wind, the world is ours
I take it in and close my eyes (ooh)
And catch the waves, I'm heading south
Leave it all behind

[Chorus]
I'm gonna stay till the sun comes up
Don't wanna go home, oh, this is my home
And when I feel I'm falling apart
Oh, it's a long road but this is my home
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-woah-oh (hey)
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-woah-oh
I'm gonna stay till the sun comes up
Don't wanna go home, oh, this is my home

[Verse 2]
Oh, you remind me of a song
With the melody in harmony (ooh)
And I could listen to you all day long
I put you on repeat

[Chorus]
I'm gonna stay till the sun comes up
Don't wanna go home, oh, this is my home
And when I feel I'm falling apart
Oh, it's a long road but this is my home
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-woah-oh (hey)
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-woah-oh
I'm gonna stay till the sun comes up
Don't wanna go home, oh, this is my home

[Bridge]
Doesn't matter where I am
Doesn't matter where I go
With you it always feels like home
Doesn't matter where I am
Doesn't matter where I go
With you it always feels like home

[Chorus]
I'm gonna stay till the sun comes up
Don't wanna go home, oh, this is my home
And when I feel I'm falling apart
Oh, it's a long road but this is my home
Oh, this is my home
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-woah-oh
Oh, this is my home
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-woah-oh
I'm gonna stay till the sun comes up
Don't wanna go home, oh, this is my home




 Spoken arrows blowing ellow
We're shooting echoes like the sun across the sky
We're on fire burn desire
We're getting higher till the stars go dark

So we try to get back before dawn moves in
We should try while it lasts till it's gone again

Baby let's take our time
I want a minute at the top of the world with you tonight
It's alright we're gonna finish up the top of the world right here tonight

Baby feathers, put together
One forever makes us feel we can fly
They will never find us or remind us
So far behind us we are lost

So we try to get back before dawn moves in
We should try while it lasts till it's gone again

Baby let's take our time
I want a minute at the top of the world with you tonight
It's alright we're gonna finish up the top of the world right here tonight
Anywhere we don't care we will be fine
Baby let's take our time
I want a minute at the top of the world with you tonight...

With you tonight...
With you tonight, night, night, night, night, night, night, ohh
Baby let's take our time
I want a minute at the top of the world with you tonight
It's alright we're gonna finish up the top of the world right here tonight
Anywhere we don't care we will be fine
Baby let's take our time
I want a minute at the top of the world with you tonight...

Night, night, night, night...




 Will you wait for me
How long will it take
Till you start to see
'Maybe's make
The eyes cry
The mind try
The loss of belief
Forever in doubt, I will be
Without love that I need
If I wanted to leave
If I wanted to breathe
Would you keep me trapped inside a heart?
All I'm wanting to give
All I'm wanting to say
I am keeping it trapped inside a heart
Trust and fear are the same
They wrestle in my head
Only one can win this game
A fight that makes
The eyes cry
The mind try
The loss of belief
Forever in doubt, I will be
Without love that I need
If I wanted to leave
If I wanted to breathe
Would you keep me trapped inside a heart?
All I'm wanting to give
All I'm wanting to say
I am keeping it trapped inside a heart
If I wanted to leave
If I wanted to breathe
Would you keep me trapped inside a heart?
All I'm wanting to give
All I'm wanting to say
I am keeping it trapped inside a heart




 Take your time and you will see
That there is something to hold on to me
Let's take our time and take it slow
Cause this is the right way to go

But I don't know what to do-o-o
I just gotta get through, this
Tu tutu tutu tu tuu, tu tutu tutu tu tuu
Every time I wonder if it's you, you did it
Tu tutu tutu tu tuu, tu tutu tutu tu tuu
Every time I wonder if it's you, I start to notice that it's you

You might break my heart you see
This fear is getting a hold on to me
I take it back, I take it slow
Cause this is the only way I roll

But I don't know what to do-o-o
I just gotta get through, this
Tu tutu tutu tu tuu, tu tutu tutu tu tuu
Every time I wonder if it's you, you did it
Tu tutu tutu tu tuu, tu tutu tutu tu tuu
Every time I wonder if it's you, I start to notice yeah

I don't want to loose all my fear
Cause then I will know you stay here
But after some thinking in on last year
I know it's you, it's you

It's
Tu tutu tutu tu tuu, tu tutu tutu tu tuu
Tu tutu tutu tu tuu, tu tutu tutu tu tuu
Tu tutu tutu tu tuu, tu tutu tutu tu tuu
Every time I wonder if it's you, you did it
Tu tutu tutu tu tuu, tu tutu tutu tu tuu
Every time I wonder if it's you, you did it
Tu tutu tutu tu tuu, tu tutu tutu tu tuu
Every time I wonder if it's you, I start to notice that it's you
Yeah now I'm pretty sure it's you




 You, you
So what if I lay my cards on the table
If I spend more time feeling the same
If I could think of a million ways to keep you
Of my mind, and out of my head
Everybody tells me I'll get over you
I ain't going anywhere

So what if I love you now
So what if it could go wrong
So what if I can't take it, take it
If we don't make it
So what if it breaks me down
So what if it could go wrong
Is it to much to hold on to, on to
With all that we've gone trough
So what if I love you

If I could think of a million ways to get you
Of my mind, and out of my head
There's a part of me that doesn't wanna lose you
I ain't going anywhere

So what if I love you now
So what if it could go wrong
So what if I can't take it, take it
If we don't make it
So what if it breaks me down
So what if it could go wrong
Is it to much to hold on to, on to
With al that we've gone trough
So what if I love you

I'm losing count of all the hours
I take a breath
When will you go away

You

So what if I love you now
So what if it could go wrong
So what if I can't take it, take it
If we don't make it
So what if it breaks me down
So what if it could go wrong
Is it to much to hold on to, on to
With al that we've gone trough
So what if I love you




 So, I know it’s there
I see it sometimes far, so far away
I’ve been wanting for so long
I gotta stop, stop, stop, stop waiting
Now my heart still beats for what it wants
Feeling like I never should
Oh, I wish I could
Now my heart still beats for what it wants
Feeling like I never should
Oh, I wish I could, I wish I could
Now I feel it’s close
I see it clearly and I won’t close my eyes
If this is all I g-g-g-g-get
I'm gonna stop, stop, stop, stop waiting
Now my heart still beats for what it wants
Feeling like I never should
Oh, I wish I could
Now my heart still beats for what it wants
Feeling like I never should
Oh, I wish I could, I wish I could
I’ve been holding back too long
Get it on before it’s gone
Can you hear it beating, oh?
Get it on before it’s gone
I’ve been holding back too long
Get it on before it’s...
I can feel, feel you
Now my heart still beats for what it wants
Feeling like I never should
Oh, I wish I could
Yeah, my heart still beats for what it wants
Feeling like I never should
Oh, I wish I could, I wish I could
Now my heart still beats for what it wants
Feeling like I never should
Oh, I wish I could, I wish I could
My heart still beats for what it wants
Feeling like I never should
Oh, I wish I could, I wish I could




 I found a lover but it didn't last
Wonderful days belong to the past
I don't know where I stand what I'm to do
Try to forget and I found someone new
So I prayed on my knees to heaven above
Send me somebody please someone to love
Let him in to my story give me your hand
Don't let me down cause I'm of to the land




 Do you really want the past, to return tomorrow morning
This you'd rather forget, when you where younger
All the sorrow and the strife, when you have just awoken
Don't want to live your life, with your eyes open

Don't you want to start up something new
Won't you let me have my way with you

Can't you see me move ahead, I just want you to follow
Why do you look so sad, your eyes are hollow

Don't you want to start up something new
Won't you let me have my way with you

[itermezzo]

Don't you want to start up something new
Won't you let me have my way with you

Don't you want to start up something new
Won't you let me have my way with you




 [Verse 1]
When I was younger, they pushed me under
They put the weight of the world on my back
They didn't believe me but now they see me
I guess they never expected that

[Pre-Chorus]
I never take it all for granted
And I work hard like the day I started
I do, I do, I do, I do
I sometimes smile when I see their faces
They're standing still while I'm going places
I do, whether I win or lose

[Chorus]
I leave it all behind but don't you worry
I'm writing stories with you on my mind
I leave it al behind and I'm not sorry
Cause I'm writing stories with you on my mind
With you on my mind

[Verse 2]
I'm not scared to say it, "Fuck you, I made it"
And I mean it in my own charming way
I'm not the greatest but sure I'll take it
I never do anything halfway

[Pre-Chorus]
I never take it all for granted
And I work hard like the day I started
I do, I do, I do, I do
I sometimes smile when I see their faces
They're standing still while I'm going places
I do, whether I win or lose

[Chorus]
I leave it all behind but don't you worry
I'm writing stories with you on my mind
I leave it al behind and I'm not sorry
Cause I'm writing stories with you on my mind
With you on my mind
With you on my mind
With you on my mind

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
I leave it all behind but don't you worry
I'm writing stories with you on my mind
I leave it al behind and I'm not sorry
Cause I'm writing stories with you on my mind
With you on my mind
With you on my mind
With you on my mind
