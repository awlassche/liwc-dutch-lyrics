Far into the night he crooned that tune
The stars went out, and so did the moon
The singer stopped playing and went to bed
While the weary blues echoed through his head
He slept like a rock - or a man that's dead

Another man down the shore
I didn't know his name
He had a long ding dong
He killed another man

Another man down the shore
I didn't know his name
He had a long ding dong
He killed another man

Another man down the shore
I didn't know his name
He had a long ding dong
He killed another man

Another man gone under
Under God we run
Another man has gone
I didn't know his name, I didn't know his name, I didn't know his name
Know his name, I didn't know his name

Brought 'em back? "Yes Ma'am"
In the bounce house? "Yes Ma'am"
In my blouse? "Yes Ma'am"
Did you buy me new shoes? "Yes Ma'am"
Buy new shoes? "Yes Ma'am"
Was he runnin' crazy? "Yes Ma'am"
Better now? "Yes Ma'am"
What you waiting for?
Choo-choo all night long

Choo-choo all night long
Choo-choo all night long
Choo-choo all night long
Choo-choo all night long
Choo-choo all night long
Choo-choo all night long
Choo-choo all night long

Another man down the shore
I didn't know his name
He had a long ding dong
He killed another man

Another man gone under
Under God we run
Another man has gone
I didn't know his name, I didn't know his name, I didn't know his name
Know his name, I didn't know his name
Know his name
I didn't know his name
Know his name

Brought 'em back? "Yes Ma'am"
In the bounce house? "Yes Ma'am"
In my blouse? "Yes Ma'am"
Did you buy me new shoes? "Yes Ma'am"
Buy new shoes? "Yes Ma'am"
Was he runnin' crazy? "Yes Ma'am"
Better now? "Yes Ma'am"
What you waiting for?
Choo-choo all night long

Choo-choo all night long
Choo-choo all night long
Choo-choo all night long
Choo-choo all night long


Another man gone under

Another man has gone
I didn't know his name, I didn't know his name, I didn't know his name
Choo-choo all night long

 [Hook]
Baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
Now come on down and do what you got to do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burning out of control

My heart is full of love and desire for you
Now come on down and do what you got to do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burning out of control

[Chorus]
Oh, satisfy the need in me
Oh baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
Now come on down and do what you got to do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burning out if control

[Bridge]
Don't you understand, baby baby please
'Cause only your good loving can set me free
Hey baby, come and satisfy the need in me
Oh baby, come and satisfy the need in me
Oh baby, come and satisfy the need in me
Hey baby, come and satisfy the need in me
Oh baby, come and satisfy the need in me
Hey baby

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause only your good loving can set me free
Hey baby, come and satisfy the need in me

[Chorus]
Oh baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
Now come on down and do what you got to do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burning out of control
Oh, satisfy the need in me
Oh baby




 [Verse 1]
I'm here in the desert, all alone
I've become afraid
I want to escape from this unreal stay
I wanna go far away from here
I'm all alone
See the land where no money, no life
Friends here are going

[Break]

[Verse 2]
I can't see shame, everything is dark
I feel like, I feel like I'm blind
I'm here in the ocean, can't stop swimming
I don't know, I don't know where I'm living
I'm getting lost, desolated, allocated
I ain't think you know
Someone let me out of this man

[Break]

[Verse 3]
Set me from the land of peace
Set me from the plane
Oh, save me
Friends become old strangers
I can't see shame, everything is dark
I feel like, I feel like I'm blind




 [Verse 1]
Baby, you can go about your business
No use in waiting up for me at night
The only thing that is on my wish list
Don't take another second of my time

[Pre-Chorus]
Little man, now can't you see?
I'm so done with you and me
Sick of living fantasies
It's not right, it's not life
You've been blind and so naive
You can't escape reality
You're not the man of my dreams tonight, no lie

[Chorus]
Don't want you back, back, back, back
No point in begging on your knees
Nothing that I haven't seen before
Don't want you back, back, back, back
I'm done with all this, "Baby, please"
You ain't gonna fuck with me, no more

Don't want you back, back, back, back
No point in begging on your knees
Nothing that I haven't seen before
Don't want you back, back, back, back
I'm done with all this, "Baby, please"
You ain't gonna fuck with me, no more

[Post-Chorus]
Heey-heey
Don't want you back
Heey-heey
Heey-heey
Don't want you back
Heey-heey

[Verse 2]
You could never end a war with flowers
Decent love will overshadow hate
Our love has joined a new world, going better
Sick of burning candles in the rain

[Pre-Chorus]
Little man, now can't you see?
I'm so done with you and me
Sick of living fantasies
It's not right, it's not life
You've been blind and so naive
You can't escape reality
You're not the man of my dreams tonight, no lie

[Chorus]
Don't want you back, back, back, back
No point in begging on your knees
Nothing that I haven't seen before
Don't want you back, back, back, back
I'm done with all this, "Baby, please"
You ain't gonna fuck with me, no more

Don't want you back, back, back, back
No point in begging on your knees
Nothing that I haven't seen before
Don't want you back, back, back, back
I'm done with all this, "Baby, please"
You ain't gonna fuck with me, no more

[Bridge]
All this toxic conversation
Every word has gone to waste
Is your bitter medication
Let me know how that taste
I come to a realization
You're just in love with the chase
Best believe you tried my patience
Ended up hands at stake

[Chorus]
Don't want you back, back, back, back
No point in begging on your knees
Nothing that I haven't seen before
Don't want you back, back, back, back
I'm done with all this, "Baby, please"
You ain't gonna fuck with me, no more

Don't want you back, back, back, back
No point in begging on your knees
Nothing that I haven't seen before
Don't want you back, back, back, back
I'm done with all this, "Baby, please"
You ain't gonna fuck with me, no more

From coast to coast and across the pond
Give it in some places

We're getting out
Upon this land
I love the rocky terrain
The heat on my skin
Between he'll breathe
The smell of the desert in the air

I love the scouring of the earth
I love the way that it was burnt
I love the sun up in the sky
I love the cold deep in the night

Are we ready for the boys and girls in the smoke?

I love the way the rain whispers
I love the sun up in the sky

Ever living, ever faithfull, ever sure, everytime
Give it in some places
On the ready

 [Refrain: Alex Clare]
Stuck in a rut you can't get out
There's too much causing you doubt
No cash, no job, no self-esteem
Me I'm takin' and I'm givin'

[Verse 1: Alex Clare]
If you got a head you should use it
Opportunity, don't want to lose it
Climb over the walls, break down all the doors
When your future calls

[Pre-Chorus: Alex Clare]
Don't let nothing hold you down
Nothing hold you down, down
Don't let nothing hold you down
Nothing hold you down, down

[Chorus: Alex Clare]
Just surviving and living
Just surviving and living
Just surviving and

They may wreck your dreams if you let them
Keep them goals in sight, don't forget them
Keep your head up high, yes the future's bright
Keep your head up high

Don't let nothing hold you down
Nothing hold you down, down
Don't let nothing hold you down
Nothing hold you down, down

 We face the difficulties of today and tomorrow
I still have a dream
It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream
I have a dream
That one day
This nation will rise up
Live out the true meaning of its creed
We hold these truths to be self-evident
That all men are created equal

I have a dream
That one day on the red hills of Georgia
The sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave-owners
Will be able to sit down together
At the table of brotherhood

I have a dream
That one day

 [Intro]
Let me go talk to the DJ
Or I'm out of here
Excuse me, mister DJ? Yep
Could you play something with a beat? What do you mean play something with a beat?
You know, something I could dance to

[Chorus]
I came to get this party jumping and sick can be
I came to get this party laugh, are you with me?
I came to start the party, ’cause I'm the party starter
So if that beating knock in, let's get it knocking harder
The dance floor, let me see your favorite dance
Put your phone away, no texting and no friend DM’s
Singing like you make me see you sing the dough boys came to see you
I'm so lone with my squad
You know that we live a lot
You know that we live a lot

[Bridge]
Alright this is no my thing
This music is higher, I'm sorry
You gon' play something else
Let me go talk to the DJ
Or I'm out of here

[Chorus]
I came to get this party jumping and sick can be
I came to get this party laugh, are you with me?

And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters
