I get sick of that same song
All day long on the radio
And I ain't saying yo play no chef on the radio
Cause yo I hope that's what you're all waiting on

But the whole damn CD sale is gone
We got labels waiting to rape us all
Ain't it so cause the radio is gotta save us all man

And I ain't gonna break your balls
If you hit that goal with a fake ass song on the radio
I just hate it all don't take me high don't take me low
Don't make me feel like flying no

It don't make me warm, it don't make me cold
It don't bring me nothing first of all
Shit's just in I heard it all man

[Chorus]
On the radio get a radio
Play me that same old
On the radio yeah the radio
O no don't wake me no
On the radio get a radio
Play me that same old
On the radio yeah the radio
What do they pay you for?

Don't get me started on them DJ's
These days, walking in the club with a briefcase
Full of cheap tapes thinking eighties shit give me a break
Fool 'm teenagers, easy fakers, don't stock up in magazine pages

Those who don't know what they need saying
Let's go where the TV takes us
Imma going some shows they got some flow
We got newcomers, long-goners
John-Does, coke-heads with long toes
Pirates screaming cats are stealing
I know how that may sound and seem
But I'll be the chef pof my own ingredients
Sea-sick man don't eat it

[Chorus]

That much airplay no music
Try to change it
What your friends say, I do it, can't blame ya
So much airplay no music
Try to change it
What your friends say, I do it, airplaying

Who's in control when I'm doing it all
Even better how does one ruin it all
What to do, shit, who to call
Is it you, wait, what's the clue of it all

Trying to get a little bit information
Turn it to a little bit inspiration
Shit I'm facing, it's amazing
I miss the days that I spent like crazy

On the radio, yeah the radio
Play me that same old shit

[Chorus] x2




 [Verse 1]
All my life I’m always on the run
I've only just begun to see
All my life looking for friends and lovers
I can be one or the other or we can just let it be

[Chorus]
Where I go, where I go, you’re with me
Where I go, where I go
Where I go, where I go, you’re with me
And I want you to know
(Hey) I’m closer than I’ll ever be
(Hey) I’m right beside you, maybe you belong...
Maybe you belong to me

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I feel like we need the trouble
Sometimes every piece just puzzles me
But believe that love needs freedom and freedom needs love And I know it ain’t easy when you feel like you don’t see me enough
But if you see in my heart you’ll see us dancing
Oh to the beat of my heart you’ll see us dancing
All my life Looking for friends and lovers
I can be one or the other or we can just let it be

[Chorus]
Where I go, where I go, you’re with me
Where I go, where I go
Where I go, where I go, you’re with me
And I want you to know
(Hey) I’m closer than I’ll ever be
(Hey) I’m right beside you, maybe you belong to me

[Bridge]
And when I leave you at four in the morning
Sleep talking when we say goodbye
Oh I can feel your heavy heart when I hold ya
But I told ya, I told ya
I told ya all my life

[Chorus]
Where I go, where I go, you’re with me
Where I go, where I go
Where I go, where I go, you’re with me
And I want you to know
(Hey) I’m closer than I’ll ever be
(Hey) I’m right beside you, maybe you belong to me
Maybe you belong to me
Maybe you belong to me
Maybe you belong to me
Maybe you belong to me
Maybe you belong to me
Maybe you belong to me

 [Intro]
I love you...

[Verse 1]
Do you want me to
Tell you something 'bout me that'll comfort you
Hair color blond, eye color blue
Socks don't match, no polished shoes
I come from a land that's covered in grass
Everybody's in love with cash
We gotta lot of that money, it's rad
Cause we shed a whole lot of blood in the past
Funny, nobody taught me in class
Stuff that we did that was awfully bad
Robbed and grabbed and conquered land
And still somehow we forget what we have
All that we have, I’ve never wanted for nothing
I wanna be thankful more often, more gentle, softer

[Pre-Chorus]
But I fool myself so well I win every time I lose
I screw myself, don’t tell me I told you that I do
I fool myself so well I win every time I lose
I fool myself

[Chorus]
I wanna be...
A better man, a true friend, a better son
Oh I want to
A better man, a version 1.1
Oh I want to

[Post-Chorus]
Because I love you
Because I love you
Because I love you
Because I love you

[Verse 2]
Do you love me too?
Tell you more before we rendezvous
I'm 5 feet 10, high people think I’m bigger on TV, that’s right
I love kids, I love people
I'd like to treat 'em all as equals
Like to have a smaller ego
No more judgement, more amigos
Lost my dad, it changed me, wrote a track, it saved me
Brought me fame, sometimes I feel shame
I made some money of his name
Got so many fears, I wanna shed more tears
The present is never more clear when I love you

[Pre-Chorus]
But I fool myself so well I win every time I lose
I screw myself, don’t tell me I told you that I do
I fool myself so well I win every time I lose
I fool myself

[Chorus]
I wanna be...
A better man, a true friend, a better son
Oh I want to
A better man, a version 1.1
Oh I want to

[Post-Chorus]
Because I love you
Because I love you
Because I love you
Because I love you

[Bridge]
I want to, I wanna be
I want to, I wanna be

[Chorus]
A better man, a true friend, a better son
Oh I want to
A better man, a version 1.1
Oh I want to
Oh I want to
Oh I want to
Oh I want to
Oh I want to

[Post-Chorus]
Because I love you
Because I love you
Because I love you
Because I love you
Because I love you
Because I love you
Because I love you
Because I love you




 [Verse 1]
I want to be the first to bite the apple, hurt the chapel, rewrite the bible, let the earth tremble
Make you pay the price for my thirst
You're fucking welcome
Drop by to paradise, let's ramble
I wanna gamble with the devil till I'm so deep in his deck
Till there's nothing that can save me
Got to pay them with my death
I'm a rebel, I'm spitting in your temple, I'm trouble
I don't know humble, let's make love, tumble
I'm rat in your city stepped on, I'll bleed to death
I'm a rat busy looking for disease to spread
I'm illegally-minded, crying for tomorrow
Running with my eyes closed, try to follow

[Chorus]
Bend down low, tell you what I know
None of y'all gon' make it if your conscience grow
Sell your soul, everything must go, half of it is money and the other half is show

[Verse 2]
I wanna shave the head of random hippies
Make them pay for living large, while dancing naked in the sixties
Go down to Disney, raped Mickey, humiliated by a standing little mermaid with a stick trying to hit me
She ain't pretty, but either way, stay with me as I wave at Britney
Fuck, I'm way past Britney
Witness my decay as I'm trying to trade a kidney for a bunch of crappy vinyls, 'cuz I feel like playing Frisbee
I wanna raise the glass to every fuck-up in this town
Never face the past, goes around come around
Claim panic, I wanna pray for second chances
Fuck them up the same second after they'd been granted

[Chorus]
Bend down low, tell you what I know
None of y'all gon make it if your conscience grow
Sell your soul, everything must go
Half of it is money and the other half is show
Bend down low, tell you what I know
None of y'all gon' make it if your conscience grow
Sell your soul, everything must go
Half of it is money and the other half is show

[Verse 3]
Step right up, step right up, cheap souls
Two for the price of one, that's ice cold
Fresh from the body, while you rock your body
Man, these are the cheapest souls I've ever sold
Brand new, you can feel 'em, hold 'em
These are the types that always did what I told them
Hahaha, poor souls, what a shame, always played by the rules and they never won a game
Today I'm practically giving them away
Tomorrow is another day, and it's time for you to pay
Today I'm practically giving them away
I've got you in my pocket, save you for a rainy day

[Chorus]
Bend down low, tell you what I know
None of y'all gon' make it if your conscience grow
Sell your soul, everything must go
Half of it is money and the other half is show
Bend down low, tell you what I know
None of y'all gon' make it if your conscience grow
Sell your soul, everything must go
Half of it is money and the other half is show




 I'm gonna be the biggest monkey
I'm gonna be the biggest monkey of them all
I'm gonna be the biggest monkey
I'm gonna be the biggest monkey of them all

All your biting and your barking will be in vain
You see me standing right on top of the food chain
I'm not gonna let my brain interfere me
I'm gonna make the other monkeys fear me
Always thought that being nice was a good thing
But now this monkey walks over anything that crosses him
My primate vision made me strong
'Cause people are animals that think too long

I'm gonna be the biggest monkey
I'm gonna be the biggest monkey of them all
I'm gonna be the biggest monkey
I'm gonna be the biggest monkey of them all

You gotta watch out when you walk over my land
I'm gonna raise hell if you talk to my girlfriend
It's gonna work in my behalf
And when I make a joke, I expect you to laugh
Thats because I'm stronger than you
My muscles make me able to tell you what to do
And I will, yes I will, 'til I'm old and gone
And new young monkeys will take over my throne

And when it comes to you, my friend
I'm gonna put your monkey behavior to an end
And I'm not gonna be easy
Somebody's got to stop you spreading monkey diseases

I'm gonna be the biggest monkey
I'm gonna be the biggest monkey of them all
The biggest, the meanest, the sickest
The loudest, the tallest, the toughest
The proudest monkey of them all now
Of them all now
I'm gonna be the biggest monkey of them all




 I wish people would stop yelling and start listening
I wish birds would start talking and stop whistling

Cause they know things that I don’t know
Seven of them sitting on that wall
Staring at a lost soul and fly away
Too close to the window

I’m looking for some info
Can I trust Google Maps’ photographs
What’s flying like, are you free above
Is it really that worth, dreaming of

Or does that to get old like making love and alcohol
Or that track you wrote that made them all dance on the dancingfloor

But the dancing floor, it ends at four
When the dancing people have to go
And there is nothing left for you to roll, than home

[Chorus]
Sun don’t shine at night
Oh no, it don’t
If only you would just open your eyes
I know i’m not alone
Is it alright if all these words don’t mean nothing at all

I wish I was from a broken home
To explain the fact that i’m cold and alone
But my family is golden so it’s probably just my own fault again

I wish those seven birds came back
And told me why this earth is wack
Cause it ain’t sync what we deserve and get
Or do you think we should work on that

Sunday evening, monday is eager to kill me like he did last week
I’m not the guy you think you need
I wish that you start missing me

And start distinguishing you and I
For we are the same and you’re in my mind
But rain replaces snow and that’s just pretty fucking lame

[Chorus] x2




 [Chorus]
We are carnivore you know what we're coming for
You got nowhere to hide
So what you're running for?
We are carnivore you know what we're coming for
The type of creature that your papa used to warn you for

[Verse 1]
Hardcore carnivore waiting for the doc to call
Tell them what's happening and then ask him what he's got in store
I'm up for all of it but none of them will got the balls
If you ain't gonna finish it
Than what the fuck the start is for?
Just ate a lot of Mcnuggets
I just got drunk at Mcdonalds
The cops are busting my ass
I filled my pockets with muffins
I just love 'm, I tried to run but they caught me
And then they punched me in the stomach and I'm coughing up nuggets

[Chorus]
We are carnivore you know what we're coming for
You got nowhere to hide
So what you're running for?
We are carnivore you know what we're coming for
The type of creature that your papa used to warn you for
We are carnivore you know what we're coming for
You got nowhere to hide
So what you're running for?
We are carnivore you know what we're coming for
The type of creature that your papa used to warn you for

[Verse 2]
I'm bad ass come ride with me
And test airbags in your Cadillac
Compare that one ride with me with your last ten years in Bagdad
Scrap that, I never been there, I can't back that
Back this, them airbags won't stand a chance your fat ass
Let's test it
Never really being good at compliments but you're pushing my head to the glass man
I'm fast man, ask them I'm everything you can't stand
I'm gon' lose my shit and flip that script
I'm just a mad man
I'm gon' lose my shit and flip that whip until we crash land
Flip that script I'm just a mad man (mad man)
Flip that script I'm just a mad man (mad man)
Flip that script I'm just a...

[Chorus]
We are carnivore you know what we're coming for
You got nowhere to hide
So what you're running for?
We are carnivore you know what we're coming for
The type of creature that your papa used to warn you for
We are carnivore you know what we're coming for
You got nowhere to hide
So what you're running for?
We are carnivore you know what we're coming for
The type of creature that your papa used to warn you for




 [Intro]
Yo, check this out
It's the Chef on the mic
You got 'em colors
I got 'em colors
No-one's black and white like that mate, no-one
Come on

[Verse 1]
I feed my life with ‘m beats ‘n rhymes
When I reach the skies ‘n I’m on my knees ‘n cry
When I ease the mind ‘n I’m leavin' ye behind
And I’m screaming: ‘Jesus Christ’ cus I can’t read it right
Try to get a grip on this ‘n make ye trip on this
Try to make ye hips can’t resist an inch of it
I got a list of ‘m things I need luck with
Tryin to be me, be real but what the fuck is?
And dark mist hits my lungs when I’m stuck with
The shit that I’m stuck with, stuff I got shit with
Fuck, I’m addicted. I can’t resist it
The fall of the siggie, I’m in love with the risk, innit?
Incomplete when I miss to see
That we all carry colors oughta share with each other
I’ma be me and you could still be you
But we be so much more if we feelin' it through

[Chorus]
Take a look at my painting baby, it’s all me
Please look carefully
Take a look what I made now baby, it’s all me
Please be careful please
Take a look at my painting baby, it’s all us
Colors out of dust
Take a look what I made now baby, it’s all me
Please be careful please

[Verse 2]
I face my fears and I taste my tears
I got no shades on stage, I’m naked up here
And all ‘m critics in line, written some lies
And why they blind for my soul ‘n they think with their minds
But yo, hatred divides us I’m digging in time
1968, the night that the king died
I can’t expect us to all think a like
But I like the idea that I think that we might
So, give it a try if ye feelin my vibe
Cus you all got ye paintin I’m giving ye mine
Why criticize, ruin it while ye doing it
Let ye eyes ride through it, please lose ye mind into it
Ssht...
So don’t talk, for so far
Silence can guide us can mend broken hearts
Lose me on the surface come ‘n meet me underneath
Cus every word I drop is another fallen son of me

[Chorus]
Take a look at my painting baby, it’s all me
Please look carefully
Take a look what I made now baby, it’s all me
Please be careful please
Take a look at my painting baby, it’s all us
Colors out of dust
Take a look what I made now baby, it’s all me
Please be careful please

[Bridge]
I wanna dream just to live for once
I wanna dream just to live for once
Wanna be free from your ignorance
I wanna scream let you whisper some
I wanna make peace just to kiss someone
I want enemies just to hit someone
And I, I wanna leave let you linger on
And I, I wanna dream just to live for once

[Chorus]
Take a look at my painting baby, it’s all me
Please look carefully
Take a look what I made now baby, it’s all me
Please be careful please
Take a look at my painting baby, it’s all us
Colors out of dust
Take a look what I made now baby, it’s all me
Please be careful please




 [Chorus]
I don't wake up till the day is done
Open my eyes in the darkness
Remember all the bad things I saw
Dreams don't come for nothing

I don't wake up till the day is done
Open my eyes in the darkness
My heart asleep and my days don't end
They have never started
They have never started
They have never started
They have never started
They have never started

[Verse 1]
Part of my rock bottom
I can't see nor hear you talking
Can't spot me, that's no problem
So don't solve it keep on walking

My flow is old and rusty
My soul is cold and dusty
My smile is so worn off when I'm happy
I don't trust me

I rap the blues
In this game of fools there are many truths
Watch me bend rules
As I roll down burned out avenue

[Pre-Chorus]
So turn that, turn that low
Turn out the music and burn it all
So turn that, turn that low
Turn out the music and burn it all

[Chorus]
I don't wake up till the day is done
Open my eyes in the darkness
Remember all the bad things I saw
Dreams don't come for nothing

I don't wake up till the day is done
Open my eyes in the darkness
My heart asleep and my days don't end
They have never started
They have never started
They have never started
They have never started
They have never started

[Verse 2]
Man, I'm a dead man walking
There's no temper rising, falling
Slave in the dark, yeah, night has laws
And nightmares keep on coming

There's a weight and it has me crawling
There's a light at the end of the tunnel
But if I stay right here and embrace that fear
I can hear my future calling

I got love and I can't be loved
I got hate and I can't be hated
I got stuck in a fake ass comfort zone
I can't run and I can't embrace it

[Bridge]
I'm done, done sleeping
I'm done, done sleeping
I'm done, done dreaming
I'm numb, no feeling
No love, no meaning
I'm on my knees and
I'm done, done sleeping
I'm done done
I'm done, done
I'm trying but I'm tired of sleeping
I'm tired of sleeping

[Chorus]
I don't wake up till the day is done
Open my eyes in the darkness
Remember all the bad things I saw
Dreams don't come for nothing

I don't wake up till the day is done
Open my eyes in the darkness
My heart asleep and my days don't end
They have never started
They have never started
They have never started
They have never started
They have never started




 I was thinking about those time that we make friemds
Just by shaking hands

Starin at that white page, hopin that it might change
Deadlines, becoming headlines, they in my way
My quality time with father time was always fine
Now it's like I'm hauntin for somthin stuck in the mind

N I just, can't understand, given some of the facts
We was always down to business right?
No matter what the catch, no matter what the cash
No matter what the next day was bringin as 'm consequences for my ass

We be, wachtin the morning sun rise, a warm surprise
After long time writin we would call it a night
'n yo my pen still damn I was holdin 'm tight
But yo there's nuttin to be stressed about right 'n father time said:

Hell no chef, we did allright
The next time I come by we'll let dumbo fly
But now it's time to boogie home cus man I'm pretty tired
U enjoy that glimpse of that last bitta sunrise

I gotta write a little bit mo(re)
Is that wat you waitin for?
Cus I don't know

I think it's time to give it a go
What's that you take me fo?
Cus I don't know

The people in this life, day by day they be changing
I turn my head for one sec, look back 'n shit is fadin
I can't keep up the pace 'n n they keep on rearranging
Now tell me is I really missin out if not participating

To that all day bullshit, let's ball play through it
I'll dribble and I'll pass it if you feel it come 'n do it
If ye have it, then shoot it, that half shit is stupid
Never blame the ball if it's lacking on ye movements

Piece of mind isn't easy to find
Not if you feel like those days are busy stealing ye nights
'n if ye feel like those nights really need you to write
And if I'd sleep every night, I'd be sleepin fo life, ye feel me?

Just let me dream the days, 'n I will live the nights
Don't wanna hear me say: 'I didn't had the time'
I got a record up the oven and that's somthin
Ain't nobody stopping that, stopping that from comin'
Chorus

I gotta write a little bit mo(re)
Is that wat you waitin for?
Cus I don't know

I think it's time to give it a go
What's that you take me fo?
Cus I don't know




 [Verse 1]
My dreams ain't any less fake nor cliche
As your neighbours or your mates on the end of this table
I just, need to say I'm grateful
Need a way to say it all
Cause out the two of us you're surely the bravest now
Please be patient with me
Please just wait and give me time
For this side in me to awake
This side in me to abide
Then I'll try to make it work
Oh, yes, I'll try to eat some dirt
Be the guy that you can lean on
Yeah, the guy that you deserve

[Pre-Chorus]
Just a bit, a bit of time and I can
I can get your peace of mind so we can
Take a breath, realign our stories
Take a breath, now, stay with me, stay with me, go!

[Chorus]
Running out of poetry
Don't let it get you down
Get up, get up, wake up now
Get up, get up, make a sound
Screaming from the side
Hoping you last another round
Get up, get up, wake up now!
Get up, get up, make a sound

[Verse 2]
Nobody's really far away nowadays
Cause we can see them on our screens
And we fulfill our instantt needs
And then, we don't know what to say
When a moment cries for meaning
We just see ‘em and it fades
And we forget we really need 'em
For the wisdom that they own
And the place that you call home
My fucking legs and feet are tired
For the grass is always greener
Man, the garden of Eden
Was a fuck up for a reason
So lets write this one together
And lets not forget to read ‘em please

[Pre-Chorus]
Just a bit, a bit of time and I can
I can get your peace of mind so we can
Take a breath, realign our stories
Take a breath, now, stay with me, stay with me, go!

[Chorus]
Running out of poetry
Don't let it get you down
Get up, get up, wake up now
Get up, get up, make a sound
Screaming from the side
Hoping you last another round
Get up, get up, wake up now!
Get up, get up, make a sound

[Chorus]
Running out of poetry
Don't let it get you down
Get up, get up, wake up now
Get up, get up, make a sound
Screaming from the side
Hoping you last another round
Get up, get up, wake up now!
Get up, get up, make a sound

[Pre-Chorus]
Just a bit, a bit of time and I can
I can get your peace of mind so we can
Take a breath, realign our stories
Take a breath, now, stay with me, stay with me, go!

[Pre-Chorus]
Just a bit, a bit of time and I can
I can get your peace of mind so we can
Take a breath, realign our stories
Take a breath, now, stay with me, stay with me, go!

[Chorus]
Running out of poetry
Don't let it get you down
Get up, get up, wake up now
Get up, get up, make a sound
Screaming from the side
Hoping you last another round
Get up, get up, wake up now!
Get up, get up, make a sound




 [Verse 1]
I got a bed in a room in a house in a street
In a city in a country unknown
Where I think about my problems
Cause yo I walk my problems home
Today there were a lot of angry people on the planet saying
Other people did them wrong
Now why they think about themselves
Rather than living all together
On a planet that's a ticking bomb?
I don't know but

[Chorus]
Everybody wants to be themselves
And everybody needs a little love
And everybody needs a little help
Just a little bit of help yo

[Verse 2]
Now I've been looking for a little bit of happy these days
I've been looking in the wrong places
And I've been spending all my loving on the wrong type of ladies
But I love them cause they don't complain
I wanna give all I have, all I have’s what i got
What I got’s what you give to me
I wanna live out of love, I don't live to end up
Thinking “man, how it could 've been”

[Chorus 2]
Everybody wants to be themselves
And everybody deserves a little love
And everybody needs a little help

[Bridge]
And everybody wants to be themselves
And everybody needs to be themselves
Everybody needs just a little help
Just a little bit of help, now
And everybody wants to be themselves
And everybody needs to be themselves
Everybody needs just a little help
Just a little bit of help, now

[Chorus]
Everybody wants to be themselves
And everybody needs a little love
And everybody needs a little help
Just a little bit of help yo




 [Verse 1]
Lately I been following a phantom
Walking through the walls gotta get the truth
Oh I been here before
I never cared about the answers
Cause they won’t get get me back back to you
And I know it

[Pre-Chorus]
It might be part of my imagination
I go out my mind just to picture you
Everything I see keeps changing
I’m blind to the danger the face of a stranger

[Chorus]
Those eyes they don’t tell the truth
That smile don’t belong to you
Everything I see keeps changing
I’m blind to the danger the face of a stranger

[Verse 2]
Push to get free from the struggle
Add another piece to the puzzle when I
Try to put a voice to the memory
I know I’ve heard it before

Oh I can ask the same old questions
But they won’t get get you back back to me
Oh I know it

[Pre-Chorus]
It might be part of my imagination
I go out my mind just to picture you
Everything I see keeps changing
I’m blind to the danger the face of a stranger

[Chorus]
Those eyes they don’t tell the truth
That smile don’t belong to you
Everything I see keeps changing
I’m blind to the danger the face of a stranger

[Brigde]
But when the pieces come together
Oh these moments in the dark
And I see you looking at me
Oh you open up my heart

Oh let me love you for this minute
Oh let me love you till you part
And then I’ll love you from a distance I will love you from afar
I will love you from afar
I will love you from afar
Oh let me love u from a distance I will love you from afar
Those eyes they don’t tell the truth
That smile don’t belong to you
Everything I see keeps changing
I’m blind to the danger the face of a stranger




 [Chorus]
Bound to be free
It has been clear from the start
I have no fear up in this heart, no boundaries
Bound to be free
But can you watch me from a distance?
Before I lose the touch and listening
And I don't feel I wanna miss what's in your heart
What's in your heart

[Verse 1]
What's in your dark past, behind your pebbles
Feel yet can't see, can't unravel
You said “follow me” but you walked behind
I had no coat on and I walked no line
You said: “Boy go there, where there's no sunshine
For the darker your journey the brighter your mind
And the brighter what you might just gonna find
Don’t load what you can't carry, walk twice”

[Chorus]
Free
It has been clear from the start
I have no fear up in this heart, no boundaries
Bound to be free
But can you watch me from a distance?
Before I lose the touch and listening
And I don't feel I wanna miss what's in your heart
What's in your heart

[Verse 2]
What's in your restless mind at the present time?
Trying to hide low and pretend the high
But you don't have to shine every time I come by
I can take it I, I'm a big guy
I know I haven't turned my head much since I left
Been working on success
Tryna learn from my regrets
Now, I hope I earn all the love I get
Sometimes I give all I have
And there's really nothing left
It ain't a curse it's a blessing
I hear you thinking, between the turns and the guessing
All is freedom
All is welcome and none is needed
I don't claim the unforseen boy, don't get greedy

[Chorus]
Free
It has been clear from the start
I have no fear up in this heart, no boundaries
Bound to be free
But can you watch me from a distance?
Before I lose the touch and listening
And I don't feel I wanna miss what's in your heart
What's in your heart

[Outro]
So I don't wanna miss what's in your heart
I don't wanna lose what's in your heart
I just wanna hold what's in your heart
'Cause I'll be back
You can show me once more

We're are free
Bound to be free, bound to be free

He’s never late clean shaved trying to make a difference man
Trying to make a living but the bosses they ain’t diggin’ him
He’s been there over thirty years and still making the minimum

Anna’s never been demanding but she’s never met a man
And no one understands it what’s the matter Anna
Why can’t you get together daddy issues or whatever Anna
Please don’t get a cat that’s the beginning of the end

Larry loved a lady and that lady loved him back like crazy
They we’re young amazing filled up with dreams n maybes
But lately he filled up with pain she went away
And nothing he could do about it lady was gay

[Chorus]
I’m packing my bags leaving tonight waiting for the good life good life

[Verse 2]
Lilly’s in her sixties right trying to live a busy life her little kids got big like that and now they hardly in her life
She keep wishing they come by but they don’t ever visit like
Maybe once or twice a year that’s pretty shitty right

Benny wants to start a band and many of his friends don’t understand ’em
They keep saying he don’t have the heart for that he don’t play an instrument and he don’t have a drummer man
Ben don’t care for none of that and Benny I got your back

Bill Anna Larry Lilly Benny and everybody out there that can hear me
Don’t forget to look around and see that it’s amazing or you can spend ya whole life waiting

[Chorus]
I’m packing my bags leaving tonight waiting for the good life good life

So I’m wasting my time until it arrives I’m just waiting for the good life good life




 [Chorus]
A million miles from being here
Thinking of my homeland
Where people run their daily lives
Living in my homeland

Oh and I thought that I wouldn't bother
But now trouble is all I see
Thinking about the other
And what my homeland, means to me
Means to me

[Verse 1]
Fifty minute bicycle trip, I'm on the beach
I could be on time to see the sun [it see me?]
Like a golden rivalry between two lovers always leads to some more lovin' yet the kind that always ends between the sheets

Fifty second walk down the hall I'm on the streets
Ball in my hand and my sneakers on my feet
Brand new Adidas ready to work it rock it yeah lets make em bleed
And youngsters from the block they may [?] fast but no technique

Oh two three, holler baby, you callin' me
Whatever chef you roll away
Oh two three, holler baby, you callin' me
Whatever chef you roll away

[Chorus]
A million miles from being here
Thinking of my homeland
Where people run their daily lives
Living in my homeland

Oh and I thought that I wouldn't bother
But now trouble is all I see
Thinking about the other
And what my homeland, means to me

[Verse 2]
Means to me we're pleased to be brothers on the road
Feeting of the freedom and [?] round the globe
Easy give it all, lose it pissin' on your principals
Till your misses on the phone whispers "I miss you so"

Homesick, hold up, brother it's a roadtrip
Close your eyes and roll into the sunshine
Know this, always, home is where the heart is
You don't need to be closest to be mine

So we cruise another mile or twenty
Beauty in the skies already music in the mind is getting ready for the show
Look behind you though, [?]
So better realize they gone before you know, away

[Chorus]
A million miles from being here
Thinking of my homeland
Where people run their daily lives
Living in my homeland

Oh and I thought that I wouldn't bother
But now trouble is all I see
Thinking about the other
And what my homeland, oh yeah my homeland

Home is where the heart is

Livin' on the road man, thinking 'bout my homeland
'bout my homeland yeah
Livin' on the road man, and thinking ah, oh, woah my homeland

Livin' on the road man, singin' 'bout my homeland
About my homeland yeah
Livin' on the road man, but I'll be singing till I'm home
Singing till I'm home, oh yeah now

[Chorus]
A million miles from being here
Thinking 'bout my homeland
Where people run their daily lives
Living in my homeland, Living in my homeland

And know the future always near
Waiting on my homeland, waiting on my homeland
Spinning till the sun appear
Shining on my homeland, shining on my homeland

Shining till I'm home man
Thinking about my homeland
Oh I'll be shining till I'm home man
Thinking about my homeland
My homeland




 [Verse 1]
I’m homesick I don’t know where my home is
I’m homesick I don’t know where my heart fits
And I’m weightless I’m passing through these places
I’m weightless stuck between silence and praises

[Chorus]
Now who is counting days so long I’ve been away
Am I lost or free I don’t want it to be all about me
Am I lost or free I don’t want it to be all about me

[Verse 2]
But I’m selfish just minding my own business
I’m selfish and I can’t seem to fix it and I don’t
Want you thinking I’m indifferent cause I’m
Homesick but the road is waiting
It called me and there’s no escaping
There’s hardly time for goodbye kisses
Goodnight wishes it’s all in the game
But I don’t need anything no if only you could
Sing me sometimes
Of those fun times of those long times ago

[Chorus]
Now who is counting days so long I’ve been away
Am I lost or free I don’t want it to be all about me
Am I lost or free I don’t want it to be all about me




 [Chorus]
There is a fine line between the two of us
We can be talking all night long like intellectuals
Sipping on fine wine, smoking diamond dust
We can be lost in our ownworld, inter-terrestrials

[Verse 1]
We all laughing but not really laughing
We all cashing but not really cashing
Labeled your ass with Scandinavian fashion
The same type of Ray-Ban's as Leo in Gatsby
We so fly, shit, we praise the classics
Read half a newspaper shaking our heads, shit
We so aware, we really, really, care, right?
Mama nature, the state of the planet
And that crazy warfare, we blame the maverick
But really we be flipping out waiting in traffic
So raise your glasses with grapes organic
The neighbors find Chardonnay tastes divine

[Chorus]
There is a fine line between the two of us
We can be talking all night long like intellectuals
Sipping on fine wine, smoking diamond dust
We can be lost in our ownworld, inter-terrestrials

[Verse 2]
We used to copy all the right kind of folk
Momma always loved you, papa always knows
Stopped you on the road when you lost control
And now we all grown up, yeah, we all gon' roll
Hit the flow, drink some more, get me yours, let me go
Call me back, never mind, all of that till we old
Some wake up in a brand new Bugatti
Let's wake up in bed with some juice and coffee

[Chorus]
There is a fine line between the two of us
We can be talking all night long like intellectuals
Sipping on fine wine, smoking diamond dust
We can be lost in our ownworld, inter-terrestrials

[Outro]
(Lost in our own world)
Million miles away
(Lost in our own world)
Know you feel the same
(Lost in our own world)
I see diamonds in your back
(Lost in our own world)
Until they fade away




 [Chorus]
There is a fine line between the two of us
We can't be talking down that long like intellectuals
Sipping on fine wine, smoking diamonds dust
We can't be lost in that old world, inter-terrestrials

[Verse 1]
We all laughing but not really laughing
We all cashing but not really cashing
Labeled your eyes for Scandinavian fashion
The same topic, great bands, it's Leo and Gatsby
We so fly, shit, we praise the classics
We have a newspaper shaking our heads, shit
We so aware, we really, really, care, right?
Mama nature, the state of the planet
And that crazy warfare, we blame the marriage
But really we be flipping out waiting in traffic
So raise your glasses with grapes organic
They may find Chardonnay taste divine

[Chorus]
There is a fine line between the two of us
We can't be talking down that long like intellectuals
Sipping on fine wine, smoking diamonds dust
We can't be lost in that old world, inter-terrestrials

[Verse 2]
We used to copy all the right kind of folk
Momma always love you, papa always knows
Stop you on the road when you lost control
And now we all grown up, yeah, we all gone rogue
Hit the flow, drink, smoking, be yours, let me go
Call me back, never mind, all of that till we all
Some wake up in a brand new Bugatti
Let's wake up in bed with some juicy cocky
And that crazy warfare, we blame the marriage
But really we be flipping out waiting in traffic
So raise your glasses with grapes organic
They may find Chardonnay taste divine

[Chorus]
There is a fine line between the two of us
We can't be talking down that long like intellectuals
Sipping on fine wine, smoking diamonds dust
We can't be lost in that old world, inter-terrestrials

[Outro]
Million miles away
Know you feel the same
I see diamonds in your back
Until they fade away




 [Verse 1]
Yo, time flies they buzz around me
Rainclouds you know they found me
Thunder sounding underground oh
I just wanna hide away
But I just don’t get it, why there’s no time like the
Present I’m guessing all these questions they don’t
Ever seem to change
But I’m not trying to stay the same
But who’s changing nowadays we just making
These rearrangements maybe making mini modifications
Please take it easy don’t be too crazy come save me

[Chorus]
Take me into the future 'cause I know
Tomorrow goin’ be better today I’m feeling low
Take me into the future 'cause I know
Tomorrow goin’ be better today is moving slow
Take me into the future

Take me into the future
Take me into the

[Verse 2]
Dreams of my eight year old me do they still
Represent me what I can’t be what I could’ve been
What I have seen
Evidently now they bad dreams
Prophetic or manic I don’t remember
They come at me no matter what every
Moment I lay down my body and head
Fuck up the present and run from the past
All of my blessings so hard to cherish
All of my lessons hard to remember
The cards in my hand they don’t talk to me ever
So call of the present I’m gone to november I’m
Ready I’m ready for the years unborn I’m ready for the inevitable
So let ’em unfold blindfolded I will follow

[Chorus]
Take me into the future 'cause I know
Tomorrow goin’ be better today I’m feeling low
Take me into the future 'cause I know
Tomorrow goin’ be better today is moving slow
Take me into the future
Take me into the future

[Brigde]
Lose all track of time, I don’t know what I’ll find but
It’s goin’ be a ride in the future in the future
Lose all track of time, I don’t know what I’ll find but
I’m goin' feel alive like I used to like I used to

[Chorus]
Take me into the future 'cause I know
Tomorrow goin’ be better today I’m feeling low
Take me into the future 'cause I know
Tomorrow goin’ be better today is moving slow
Take me into the future

[Outro]
Take me into the future




 [Verse 1]
Know you’re gone, I know you’re gone
But I don’t feel what I know
I know you’re gone, I know you’re gone
But my mind ain’t in control
Cause it’s my heart that’s been missing you
And it’s the heart I need to listen to
And it’s been singing songs for tender dreams
The one's you sang to help us sleep
And one day I will sing those songs
Sing them ‘till they sleep
Just like you sang to me
Just like you sang, sang to me

[Chorus]
From the day that I met you I stopped feeling afraid
In your arms I feel safe
In your arms I feel safe
From the day that I met you I stopped feeling afraid
In your arms I feel safe
In your arms

[Verse 2]
I miss you so, I miss you so
And I’ll miss you ‘till i’m old
I miss you so, I miss you so
But my fears will fade, I know
‘cause it’s my heart that you helped to build
And love is my compass still yeah
Love will fill the holes I’ve got
‘cause you will never hold me
But I know that you are with me, and I know that you're in peace
Cause you let us sing to sleep
You let us sing your heart to sleep

[Chorus]
From the day that I met you I stopped feeling afraid
In your arms I feel safe
In your arms I feel safe
From the day that I met you I stopped feeling afraid
In your arms I feel safe
In your arms I feel safe

[Pre-Chorus]
And i know that you are with me
And i know that you have peace
Cause you let us sing your soul, your mind and heart to sleep

[Chorus ]
From the day that I met you I stopped feeling afraid
In your arms I feel safe
In your arms I feel safe
From the day that I met you I stopped feeling afraid
In your arms I feel safe
In your arms I feel safe
From the day that I met you I stopped feeling afraid
In your arms I feel safe
In your arms I feel safe
From the day that I met you I stopped feeling afraid
In your arms I feel safe
In your arms

[Outro]
I miss you so, I miss you so
And I’ll miss you ‘till I’m old




 [Verse 1]
Julie was a girl like no other
She used to have a style that would make 'em boys stutter
And everytime she rocked that stage with a mic in her hand
She made me a bit more desperate to be in a band
Now she was in love the world and in love with the game
No need for dessert but a hunger for fame
Yeah spitting flows like a waterfall
Banging on that wall
A bad bitch gonna break it all
Twenty year old wrecking ball
But then that ball crashed into this guy
And then she kissed all her dreams goodbye

[Chorus]
Julie Julie Julie
I've been thinking 'bout the things you could've been
Julie Julie Julie
So what happened to my favourite high school queen

[Verse 2]
Yeah Julie she turned into a momma
Leaving all 'em boys behind and man they never caught her
Cause Julie was hot no matter whether summer or fall
She was praised on the block she was all rock 'n roll
And she became that lady with a belly and a baby
And a man and a Mercedes and she never rocked the stage again
I have to say I wasn't ready for 'em sudden changes
Loved the way she played her cards like all of 'em were fucking aces
But then she looked
Looked into his eyes
And then she kissed all her dreams goodbye

[Chorus]
Julie Julie Julie
I've been thinking 'bout the things you could've been
Julie Julie Julie
So what happened to my favourite high school queen

[Bridge]
Turned out to be turned out to be
Oh man I never could've known
Turned out to be turned out to be
She was happy as never before
But Julie time to let you go
You're like no other took me so long just to see you grow
And I keep thinking 'bout

[Chorus]
Julie Julie Julie
I've been thinking 'bout the things you could've been
Julie Julie Julie
So what happened to my favourite high school queen

Julie Julie Julie
I've been thinking 'em things I've been thinking 'bout 'em things that you could've
Julie Julie Julie
So what happened to my favourite high school queen
Oh Julie




 [Chorus]
You got the lies in your favour
You got the ice with no flavour
You’re on the rise but you’re in disguise
You don’t run the miles, but you claim ’em
Getting better at it, bigger paper
Bigger desk, better view, bigger danger
King in the making, living in a daydream
Listen to the snake whispering, it's amazing
All for taking, laws you can break ’em
Bend ’em or change ’em, Panama papers
Ever so gracious, hell is just another place
Never hesitate, you’re a devil or an angel

[Refrain]
Bookie, jungle bookie, you’re an animal
You act like a beggar, but you have it all
Jungle bookie, jungle bookie, you’re a criminal
Tell me how you’re gonna spend it when they end it all

[Verse 2]
Coming out the gates, you wanna win another race
Oh, like you need another dollar fit the color of your collar
Green is the only one you dream of that you in need of
Freedom gets another meaning when you clean up
Used to run the show, but now you’re running outta options
Do you know who to love, know who to run from
When you don’t have no conscience
Can’t fit the bill in that pocket
You aim to fill up that pocket
No silver stains on gold watches
Real with the game ‘cause it pay your profits

[Refrain]
Bookie, jungle bookie, you’re an animal
You act like a beggar, but you have it all
Jungle bookie, jungle bookie, you’re a criminal
Tell me how you’re gonna spend it when they end it all

[Chorus]
You got the lies in your favour
You got the ice with no flavour
You’re on the rise, but you’re in disguise
You don’t run the miles, but you claim ’em
Getting better at it, bigger paper
Bigger desk, better view, bigger danger
King in the making, living in a daydream
Listen to the snake whispering, it's amazing
All for taking, laws you can break ’em
Bend ’em or change ’em, Panama papers
Ever so gracious, hell is just another place
Never hesitate, you’re a devil or an angel




 You were busy with your phone in the bathroom
Lately I can smell a strange perfume
You came home on a midnight hour
You were heading straight for the shower
And when I ask you why, you don't look me in the eye, no
Trying to come up with another lie
But I know, yes I know that
I know my baby lie to me
It's hard to live with, but I can't quit it
I know my baby lie to me
But don't you worry, she'll be sorry
I know my baby lie to me
And I can't seem so cope
So secretly I keep a little hope
I saw you paid an hotel for a few days
You told me you're gonna stay at a friends place
You don't know that I know but I know long time
(oh long time I know)
That you sleep with someone else and you're not mine
(you're not mine)
I know I should be furious
But I just want the two of us
To be like nothing's ever changed
But I know yes I know that
I know my baby lie to me
It's hard to live with, but I can't quit it
I know my baby lie to me
But don't you worry, no, she'll be sorry
I know my baby lie to me
Should tell him that we're done
But I still think about how we begun
I recognize the old times in your face
Wishing to go back to better days
Back when you longed for me alone
And your embrace still felt like home
Yes I know that she lie to me, lie to me now, I know
I know my baby, you lie to me
(But I, But I)
But I want, now I want him to cry to me
Yes I want her to cry to me
(Yes I want him to cry to me)
I know my baby lie to me
But I want her to cry to me
I want him to cry to me
I know my baby lie to me
But I want her to cry to me




 [Verse 1]
Tell me why now people still can't take it easy
I see some folks, they lose control
People hating for no real reason
Come down hard and crush your soul
People still afraid of freedom
What's so hard? Just let it go
And I know mistakes, we need them
But we had enough of them down the road

[Pre-Chorus]
All y'all cynical haters ain't gonna mess up my flow
You better get your black Marias 'cause I'm out of control

[Chorus]
I got a message for you
I'ma burn it down, set it on fire
I got a message for you
I'ma take it to the streets, start a love riot

[Verse 2]
I ain't the kind of guy to waste my time, no
I ain't the kind of guy to waste behind, no way, no way
I've been, I've been looking at the builder
I've been looking at the stone heat ones for fuse
And I know now, here the truth, what you get’s gon’ come to you

[Pre-Chorus]
All y'all cynical haters ain't gonna mess up my flow
You better get your black Marias 'cause I'm out of control

[Chorus]
I got a message for you
I'ma burn it down, set it on fire
I got a message for you
I'ma take it to the streets, start a love riot

[Bridge]
Love, love, love
The kind of love your momma gave you
Love, love, love
Love
The kinda, kinda love that your momma gave you
That your momma gave you
Love, the kinda, kinda love that your momma gave you
That your momma gave you

[Pre-Chorus]
All y'all cynical haters ain't gonna mess up my flow
You better get your black Marias 'cause I'm out of control

[Chorus]
I got a message for you
I'ma burn it down, set it on fire
I got a message for you
I'ma take it to the streets, start a love riot
I got a message for you

I got a message for you
I'ma take it to the streets, start a love riot

They get me going in the morning when I'm insecure
So thanks bro, that's all
Sincerely yours
Yo Chefie, this might be a long shot

 [Chorus]
Money is the root of all evil
From the penthouse down to the slum
Money is the root of all evil
No matter where you come from

[Verse 1]
We got that quick money that one hit money
That play for the risk yeah that all in money
That slow money got the bloodmoney
The old and the new and the gunshot money

[Pre-Chorus]
On the surface it’s all fields of gold
If we don’t dig a little deeper we may never know

[Chorus]
Money is the root of all evil
Money is the root of all evil
From the penthouse down to the slum
Money is the root of all evil
Money is the root of all evil
No matter where you come from

[Verse 2]
That who cares money, up in the air money
That big talk show not really there money
That get lost money, that want more money
That hand shake rat race front row money

Oh that heartbreak money, that someday money
That burned bridge, looking back lost your way money
Oh that frustrate money, making not enough money
I’ve lost and I hate, but I love my money

[Pre-Chorus]
On the surface it’s all fields of gold
If we don’t dig a little deeper we may never know

[Chorus]
Money is the root of all evil
Money is the root of all evil
From the penthouse down to the slum
Money is the root of all evil
Money is the root of all evil
No matter where you come from

[Brigde]
From the royals down to the pawns
From the muscle up to the don
From your fathers down to your sons

Stuck in this game we are

From the cradle down to the grave
We are born to be slaves
Of the debts we need to pay

[Chorus]
Money is the root of all evil
Money is the root of all evil
From the penthouse down to the slum
Money is the root of all evil
Money is the root of all evil
No matter where you come from

Money is the root of all evil
Money is the root of all evil
From the penthouse down to the slum
Money is the root of all evil
Money is the root of all evil
No matter where you come from




 It´s my night off
It´s my night off
Ooh yeah, Friday eve
Big it up we survived the week
We ain't got no show tonight
And that means we got all the night
To buy me drinks, socialize
Meet new people, show 'm why
It's allright to make it last
Roll 'n dance 'til morning light
Now who that, all alone
The girl in the dress looking at her phone
Phone ain't gonna let her know
Shit she don't allready know
Man I feel responsible
To let her know she got it all
Buy that drink, set the tone
It's my night off, you know we all
Left our mind home, you know we roll
It's my night off, you know we all
Left our mind home, you know we roll
Damn! tough chance
The girl in the dress got a love romance
That's no biggie I just simply
Ask her if she loves to dance
The mind awaits, hesitates
The body talks, anticipates
Before ye know we on the floor
'n damn yo... we elevate
Now that's that, look right, look left
I know we still got sum night left
Clock says four, clubs close
But the group we roll with opens doors
I feel like a troublemaker
Feel like makin sum mistakes
'n later on i'll blame it on
I'm drunk, it's my night off
It's my night off, you know we all
Left our mind home, you know we roll
It's my night off, you know we all
Left our mind home, you know we roll
Tryin to keep the group together
Man, this feels like forever
Someone please, speak to me cus I can't figure out what happened
What happened, what happened
Can't figure out
What happened
What happened, what happened
Can't figure out
What happened
It's my night off, you know we all
Left our mind home, you know we roll
It's my night off, you know we all
Left our mind home, you know we roll
It's my night off, you know we all
Left our mind home, you know we roll
It's my night off, you know we all
Left our mind home, you know we roll




 [Intro]
I wanna be in your heart I wanna be in your light
Make me dance in the dark keep me up all night
This could be a new start

[Chorus]
I wanna be in your heart I wanna be in your light
Make me dance in the dark keep me up all night
I wanna be in your heart I wanna be in your light
And it will never be the same it started off with a
Spark turning into a flame
This could be a new start

[Verse 1]
Turn the page another round
I’m on my way a new chapter
Take a break slow it down

Day after day I feel it happening
I try to shed my skin
So I can feel new so I can feel you

[Chorus]
I wanna be in your heart I wanna be in your light
Make me dance in the dark keep me up all night
I wanna be in your heart I wanna be in your light
And it will never be the same it started off with a
Spark turning into a flame
This could be a new start

[Verse 2]
My winter sleep was bittersweet
The realest dreams and no ending
I only wanna close my eyes to witness something brighter
I only wanna make the jump if I know it frightens me

I’m waking up alive why make up for lost time
If I can feel new if I can feel you

[Chorus]
I wanna be in your heart I wanna be in your light
Make me dance in the dark keep me up all night
I wanna be in your heart I wanna be in your light
And it will never be the same it started off with a
Spark turning into a flame
This could be a new start

[Brigde]
The page must be blank for it all to appear
I’ll take your hand if you embrace my fear
There’s always a chance that we end up back here
The page must be blank for it all to appear
This could be a new start




 [Verse 1]
Are you really feeling better?
‘Cause I’m still high on you
Did he give you all the answers?
Does he need you like I do? (Like I do, like I do)

[Chorus]
Now you won’t let me sleep
‘Cause your love is like a drug; all I need
Now I’ve fallen way too deep
But I’d rather be with you than be free

[Verse 2]
Maybe I just don’t remember
All your words and what they mean
But, baby, I just can’t forget you
I need you more than nicotine (nicotine, nicotine)

[Chorus]
And you won’t let me sleep
‘Cause your love is like a drug; all I need
Now I’ve fallen way too deep
But I’d rather be with you than be free

[Bridge]
(Nicotine)
And I’m just trying to dream ‘cause I don’t wanna feel
(Nicotine)
Till I wake up and find you and none of this is real
And you won’t let me sleep
'Cause your love is like a drug to me

Oh, let me sleep
Oh, all I need
Oh, way too deep
But I’d rather be with you, rather be with you

[Chorus]
Oh, let me sleep (let me sleep)
‘Cause your love is like a drug; all I need (all I need)
And I’ve fallen way too deep (way too deep)
But I’d rather be with you than be free

[Outro]
Are you really feeling better?
‘Cause I’m still high on you
Are you really feeling better?
Does he need you like I do?
Does he need you like I do?
Does he need you like I do?
Does he need you like I do?




 [Verse 1]
Hi it's nice meeting ya
How's his night treating ya?
I'ma do some sightseein'
And I might be needing ya
Are you alone?
Did you bring a chaparone with ya?
There's nothing wrong if I step into the zone with ya
True or false
Who to call my conscious
Left them at the doorstep
In the moment that I met you in that dark dress
Oh, guess what he ain't picking up
Well that could be a pity if I'd really give a fuck
And I do, but I don't ,not for now, all is well
I'm high by your smell and I can't hear 'em bells ringing
I'm thinking, girl, you're really something else
Or is that just what happens when I'm talking to myself

[Chorus]
I don't know but nights like this
Get feelings I can't resist
I think I wanna kiss you but I can't
Cause you already got a boyfriend
I don't know but nights like this
Got feelings I can't resist
I think I wanna kiss you but I can't
Cause you already got a boyfriend
You already got a boyfriend, you already got a boyfriend
You already got a boyfriend
And I already got a girl

[Verse 2]
I can't afford to make mistakes like this
But something in me really wants to taste your kiss
Now, I love my miss but I
I hate to miss out on a situation that's crazy like this
See the eye has no master
It does what it does
It is what it is
And it loves what it loves
And mine can't really be controlled that much
They don't know that much
And I hold no grudge
No that's a waste of time
I got better ways to spend the night
You and me, maybe little bitta candle light
A little joke, half a smile and a glass of wine
I have to stop dancin' with the devil inside

[Chorus]
Cause I already got a girlfriend
That's oh so close to me
She loves me and she comforts me
She always knows the perfect thing to say
And man I have no gaps to fill
She knows me like you never will
Yet, I'm here digging
Digging my own grave

[Outro]
Oh, girl, ain't no doubt about it
You're really somethin'else ain't ya?
We just makin conversation, right?
No offence, non taken
(I don't know but nights like this)
Oh, maybe just a little kiss
Baby nothing serious
(Get feelings I can't resist)
I’m suck in my limitless 'n your deliciousness
I dont know but nights like this
Maybe just a little kiss really really innocent
(Got feelings I can't resist)
Baby I be digging this
Yes I be digging..

(Don’t know but nights like this
Get feelings I can’t resist
Don’t know but nights like this
Get feelings I can’t resist
Don’t know but nights like this
Get feelings I can’t resist
Don’t know but nights like this
Get feelings I can’t resist
Don’t know but nights like this
Get feelings I can’t resist
Don’t know but nights like this
Get feelings I can’t resist
Don’t know but nights like this
Get feelings I can’t resist)




 [Intro]
In a land of hope
There's a river running low
In a land of hope
They know
They know
They know how this river flows

[Verse 1]
Cause it flows back into the days in times
Back into the fighting blind
Burning fire, crashing lightnin
First steps on the story line
And the river don't flow for me, no
That river is cold to me
Wash away my traces man
All my tracks are gone

It takes a million years to find out where I'm coming from

[Chorus]
I know, I don't know that much
I'm getting dumber by the year
Trying to embrace it all
Even now I'm so much older
Still feels like I'm on your shoulders
On your shoulders

[Verse 2]
Look around and think about all the times that you carried me
Close my eyes and catch your wind up in our family tree
Be blocking your eyes with my hands and I told you directions that you had to walk
Exactly the way that I told you to walk
And you did it cause I was your son

I know exactly where I'm coming from

[Chorus]
I know, I don't know that much
I'm getting dumber by the year
Trying to embrace it all
Even now I'm so much older
Still feels like I'm on your shoulders
On your shoulders
On your shoulders
On your shoulders

[Bridge]
No matter how high, no matter how high, no
No matter where I, no matter where I go
No matter how high, no matter how high, no
No matter where I go I know I'm always on your

[Chorus]
I know, I don't know that much
I'm getting dumber by the year
Trying to embrace it all
Even now I'm so much older
Still feels like I'm on your
On your shoulders
On your shoulders
On your shoulders
On your shoulders
On your shoulders
On your shoulders
On your shoulders
Still feels like I'm on your shoulders




 [Verse 1]
You must be from Jupiter cause ye make me feel like a man in a rocket
You're so peculiar make me sing make me dance like a puppet now
You're so peculiar just wanna be on your planet forever now
Forever now

[Chorus]
(Whoooh) I don't need ground control now
(Whoooh) Man i'm burning my bridges
(Whoooh) If you walk in on my old life
(Whoooh) Please say hi to the Mrs

[Verse 2]
Say hi to the past when he rolls by
Everytime he a taller guy
If one day he won't fit your house no more
Don't be surprised

Say hi to the dude with the golden watch
Shake hands with the man who lost his touch
Highfive the kid that don't seem to fit the script of his time

Send my regards to all 'em coulda been woulda been shoulda beens
I hope they be fine without me

[Chorus]
(Whoooh) I don't need ground control now
(Whoooh) Man i'm burning my bridges
(Whoooh) If you walk in on my old life
(Whoooh) Please say hi to the Mrs

[Bridge]
You must be from Jupiter cause ye make me feel like a man in a rocket
You're so peculiar make me sing make me dance like a puppet now
Do what you want girl

[Chorus]
(Whoooh) I don't need ground control now
(Whoooh) Man i'm burning my bridges
(Whoooh) If you walk in on my old life

(Whoooh) I don't need ground control now
(Whoooh) Man i'm burning my bridges
(Whoooh) If you walk in on my old life
(Whoooh) Please say hi to the Mrs




 [Verse 1: Pete Philly]
I was young and hungry
Energy of ten MCs
Had to get you, then I got ya
Like I'm ten MCs
Every single battle that I crossed they remember me
As that MC that could freestyle for days, literally
Give it to me was nothing, except that something that
Sepperated me from those that hated me
I remember vividly what he did to me
This mentor, that objective, my style the law
Introduced me to the game, I respected my name
Anybody singing live would quickly go insane
In the mean time, as I continued my grind
I was here, chage your distance
Indeed that was mine
My energy quickly turned into paranoia
Like that means that I suppose I'll quickly destroy ya
Wack tunes, wack tunes, So I let it go
Am I just a composer
We all need to grow
So, so, so, so, so, so

[Hook: Joshua, Pete Philly, E1 Ten]
The road I walk on is always lonely
The other roads they'd be mostly phony
And if you think that you've come to know me
Oooh please

[Verse 2: Joshua]
You talk about it like you're all about
But you jump around it
Moving your mouth a bit make ye sound slick
But nothing's coming out of it
Trying to hold me down a bit
I'm coming out, try to hold me down, I'm coming now
Say I'm nicking your flow, said you did it before
But man he did it before, no way who did it before?
I just spit what I know
While you're sitting on your throne
And you're digging on your own just a little too long, ain't it?
You see it all, you're ten feet tall
But you can't hit the b'loon cause your wein's too small (whaat?)
I ain't your shelt rock, I'm your Mau'faq, I'm your roadblock
Making sure your whole fucking flow stops

[Verse 3: E1 Ten]
Patience and persitence
Is what it takes in order to get this
This ain't no picknick, no walk in the park
Into hip-hop ever since I was a kid
Ever since these so called...
Golden years throughout the years
I've seen many MCs go home in tears
I've seen carreers last no longer than a year
They drop a track with a lyric and then they dissapear
Just like that, never to be heard of again
As for me, I got different plans
Want this whole wide world to know about me man
I'm Ten, I'm known as Gotcha!
Damn, I've got the munchie
I'm an order to Chef'Special
Mmmmwaaah, Chef'Special

[Hook: Joshua, Pete Philly, E1 Ten]
The road I walk on is always lonely
The other roads they'd be mostly phony
And if you think that you've come to know me
Oooh please

The road I walk on is always lonely
The other roads they'd be mostly phony
And if you think that you've come to know me
Oooh please

[Instrumental]

The road I walk on is always lonely
The other roads they'd be mostly phony
So if you think that you've come to know me
Oooh please
The road I walk on is always lonely
The other roads they'd be mostly phony
And if you think that you've come to know me
Oooh please babe
Oooh please babe
Oooh please babe


[Part 2]
[Hook]
I wish I'll ever see you do, move, just like I move
Oh just do, just like I do. Oh
Why can't that just be you, that just be you
I wish I'll ever see you sleep and dream
Just like I sleep and dream
You told me you was gonne make it right

[Verse 1]
I could get all political and stuff if you'd like
If my vibe's not enough, then Imma spit in that mic rough
Describe what and why your government lies
They're putting dimes in their own pockets under the sky
Thats right, sometimes lies don't take place under the sky
On the rooftop of the Whitehouse, what a surprise
War-fighting, bombs-dropping fuckers for life
Nothing but to shoulder their dads
Not to forget that woman, that lovable child
They all die the moment that the bomb strikes
Heat still fucking up their bodies and minds
But yo thats allright to them, they got their goldmines
What be that power and greed leading us to such greed
For good erease that shit if people believe
That love reaches way deep change can be made for that day

[Hook]
I wish I'll ever see you do, move, just like I move
Oh just do, just like I do. Oh
Why can't that just be you, that just be you
I wish I'll ever see you sleep and dream
Just like I sleep and dream
You told me you was gonne make it right

[Verse 2]
We could, we could neglect
Except the facts
Forget the present, damn yo forget the past
And let it all pass, smoke a little bit of the grass
Hide behind fiction, for real life is fast
Sometimes way to fast for me, I can't catch up
But that shit's misleading, leaves you messed up
Your eye from the ball, that's exactly what they want
They use that to pull shit on us and play dumb
The next statement they make we'd be like 'okay..'
They're eve little pricks
They're lying in your face
And they just get away with it
Get to fucking play with it
Ay now that's some crazy shit
You sit and wait for it
I ain't gonna be that fucking puppet
Ain't no bait
No thats not what we put here
Thats not what we made no
If that shit is true Imma fall down and break
Break

[Hook]
I wish I'll ever see you do, move, just like I move
Oh just do, just like I do. Oh
Why can't that just be you, that just be you
I wish I'll ever see you sleep and dream
Just like I sleep and dream
You told me you was gonne make it right

[Verse 3]
Ah
And if you need it, well come on seek it
Let you forget to play your part of the show
Well if you need it now
Bring your secrets
Its time to strip that hate you got to the bone
And if you need it, well come on seek it
Let you forget to play your part of the show
Well if you need it now
Bring your secrets
Its time to strip that hate you got to the bone
You with me?
I said to the bone!




 [Verse 1:]
I quit smoking three hours a go
Maybe there's still hope for my burned down soul
But, then again, hows it so
I got a cig up in my mouth yo down I go

Nobody here to judge me though
Nobody here to stop me no
Walkin down the road with my megaphone
My pants down low, my big hat on

Notice I been flowin on these roads
For long time, notice I been throwin shows
As I go by, we was so fine
You would hold me in the night

And if there'd be a one way ticket to
Those days, I'ma jump up go get it
And go away, yes I'd go away
If you'd hold me in the night

Ye keep on lookin keep on lookin in your mirror, to the ground
Thinking what's there to deliver if there ain't no one around
And if there's no one here to give ye what ye lost 'n haven't found
Well then it's clear to me, why you 'n me just fell in love with sound

[Chorus:]
I don't get it don't get it, just let me now
I don't get it don't get , just help me out
I don't get it now, I'm all out
Out of words and out of sound
(2x)

[Verse 2:]
Scribblin this 'n I'm scribblin that (2x)
I pity the fools that ain't skippin the track
Cus this what you get man this the track
I don't give a damn if you thinking it's wack

Light up another one people are sleepin
Light up another one people are dreamin
Light up another one nobody sees me
Light up another one

Ye keep on lookin' keep on lookin' in your mirror, to the ground
Thinking what's there to deliver if there ain't no one around
And if there's no one here to give ye what ye lost 'n haven't found
Well then it's clear to me, why you 'n me just fell in love with sound

[Chorus]

Scribbelin this 'n I'm scribbelin that (2x)

[Chorus]




 [Verse 1: The Indien]
If we could swim in the dark, the seas splashish splash
You lift me up, like I'm the air
And the clouds we left behind, they leaving a sunrise to find them back
Tell me could we ever, could we ever found again some more, the kind that makes you forget

[Chorus: The Indien]
Feels so good when we're wasting time
You're my shot in the dark, shot in the dark
Feels so good when we're wasting time
You're my shot in the dark, shot in the dark

[Verse 2: Joshua Nolet]
Leave with me, fly like this
Cheap tickets for a silent trip
And I don't mean nothing extreme, babe
I'm just trying to reach your eyes a bit
Go, baby go, dine for two
I'mma stay close till I'm with you
Do you wanna jump with your eyes closed, you ask me, yes I do
Yes I do a hundred times, off the rocks out in my mind
And ain't no heart and up I climb, a hundred times, my love is blind
You make me feel like a lion, when you talk with new life, with me
A new life, with me

[Chorus: The Indien]
Feels so good when we're wasting time
You're my shot in the dark, shot in the dark
Feels so good when we're wasting time
You're my shot in the dark, shot in the dark

[Brigde: The Indien & Joshua Nolet]
Give me something, I don't need much
I could do all day with one touch
You know this, you know this
I'm in love
Keep walking, I'll keep you safe
I can wait 'till you're lost on the way
You know this, you know this
I'm in love
Give me something, I don't need much
I could do all day with one touch
You know this, you know this
I'm in love
Keep walking, I'll keep you safe
I can wait 'till you're lost on the way
You know this, you know this
I'm in love
Give me something I don't need much
I'm in love
Keep walking, I'll keep you safe
I'm in love
Give me something I don't need much
I'm in love
Keep walking, I'll keep you safe
I'm in love




 This ain't ye average sixteen bars of spittin
A penny for ye thoughts if you're thinking what I'm thinking
And if ye feel 'm, step into my rhythm
I'll take you there, take you there

To something bigger, you know there's something bigger
Together we might have the chance big enough to get there
And if we get there, let's sit down 'n listen
This is us, this is the beginning

You might just not like it, might just dig it
Might just rewind it, might feel like skipping
It might just be blindin, it might give ye vision

Smile, dance, cry, sing, you might just nog listen

This ain't ye average sixteen bars of spittin
A penny for ye thoughts if you're thinking what I'm thinking
And if ye feel 'm, step into my rhythm
I'll take you there, take you there




 Down and out
In Budapest and Los Angeles
I drank a river to forget
To forget about the coming storm
The curtains are down
The lights are off
And the doors are closed
I think about this life I've known
And I hope this time
I won't let it goWill you catch me when I run
Will you stop me when I'm done
When the day is through
All I want to do is slow down
When I call on you
Will you help me to slow downI walk alone through this place
I can't find my way
This house is just an empty space
I never felt it was my home
Where've you been
I stole, I lied
I've hurt, I've sinned
My path has led
Me here again
There's splinters in my
Knees and bonesWill you catch me when I run
Will you stop me when I'm done
When the day is through
All I want to do is slow down
When I call on you
Will you help me to slow downEvery time I start to break
You pull me back
And help me stay
You struggle with me
There's splinters in my
Knees and bones
I try to find my
Way back home
You struggle with me
I try to find my wayWill you catch me when I run
Will you stop me when I'm done
When the day is through
All I want to do is slow down
When I call on you
Will you help me to slow down




 People runnin around
Screamin somthin is down
But ey, nuttin is down, it’s all stuck in the mind
Somthin somthin to find all the time
You got ye Eye on the ball, yet ye falling behind

Tick tack it’s the clock check the wrist
The pit stop isn’t really somthin that we wish
It’s us thinking that we must pick up this phone
Just becus it ……. Rings yo

‘where the fuck u at?!’

Stress, that’s what next, neglect ye rest
Accept the facts, we got deadlines to catch
Could ye check my desk cus their sendin a fax
They depend on my ass, fast! I’ll rest when I’m dead

Right, it’s outrageous, shit is dangerous
Burn outs ‘n breakdowns yep that ‘ll waste us
That ‘ll brake us, watches ‘n races
Now come on let’s face this were locked up in cages

Slowdown, I’m missin all ye rhythm
I don’t mind to give into ye system
That’s allright if we take time for chillin
And don’t let the time pass u by
(sec time: and don’t let the clock rule your life)

Same old shit different day
But the main roads split when the shivering fade
I say don’t trip but just give it a day
Cus time ticks…. And keeps ticking away

But we don’t mind that’s ok, we be fine
Take a little zip a wine chillin while it’s primetime
It ain’t a crime, lying to ye boss while ye fine
Pretendin to be sick drinking vodka ‘n lime

Sometimes I just never give a shit about whatever comes by
Let me give it a try: feelin the vibe right, Chill ‘n unwind
I’m willing to jive, I got life
And I be willing to live mine

Is it the time? Is the rhyme?
Is it the sunshine tickling my mind?
Is it the rhyme, no fo sho it’s what I am
Combined with that slow motion time

Slowdown, I’m missin all ye rhythm
I don’t mind to give into ye system
That’s all right if we take time for chillin
And don’t let the time pass u by
(sec time: and don’t let the clock rule your life)

It’s time to wake up now open your eyes
It’s time fo changes now go and you’ll find
That little bit of life, little piece of mind
That u lost when u checked out the clock

Slowdown, I’m missin all ye rhythm
I don’t mind to give into the system
That’s allright if we take time for chillin
And don’t let the time pass u by
(sec time: and don’t let the clock rule your life)

We comin for ye daughters
Their virginities
Nobody here to stop us
Cus we got illabeats
'n we got 'm stinking feet
Sweaty socks up in our sneakers
Jumpin, spittin, rockin in ye citystreets

[Chorus]
Who got the biggest toys?
Chef'special
Makin ye boy feelin
Less special
Who bout to grap the mic?
Chef'special
Makin ye guy feeling
Less special

[Outro]




 [Verse 1:]
I put my shades on I'm ready for the day yo
The sun is hot and I'm ready for the rain yo
You look at me, I can't resist
Your eyes don't move and they never miss

There's somthin bout your way that I can't let go now
Your pride, your beauty, from head to toe now
There's love, they tell me, there's love I know
But my feet telling me that I have to go and yo

I don't know what I'm suppose to say
When you telling me you're willing to go all the way
My words don't work on this conversation babe
Can't we do this another day

[Chorus:]
I know you're not mine, but stick around, just stick around for now
I know you're not blind, but stick around, just stick around for now
I know it's not your style to live in doubt but stick around for now
I'll try, to make you feel like home

[Verse 2:]
No need to tell me that's my grand mistake
Let you stay, everyday, kiss your cares away
I'm a fool for those tears on your cheeks
You're here so now weep, let me sing you to sleep
You don't trust me textin around
I get upset when your ex is in town
I see your face change, getting frustrated
When you can't figure out what I'm thinking about, but

I don't know what I'm suppose to think
When you fire all these questions bout the smallest things
My words don't work on this conversation babe
Can't we do this another day

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
I lift you up and turn you down
Try to keep it cool but girl I just don't know how
It sounds so simple when you say
It's just a little thing I'm gonna have to change
But it seems so outa place, it seems so far away
Babe, can't we do this another day now

[Chorus] (2x)




 [Verse 1]
My daddy always said: 'Spread love, it will come back
Paint your heart red, like a sunset
Nothing but a rough sketch, boy that's enough said
Go and live your life
Don't roll with the wrong cats'

The rights and wrongs, the wrongs and rights
There's a righteous wrong in the songs I write, right?
I like to juggle with the right amounts of wrongs
As I'm struggling at night as I write another song

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I've seen 'em coming, seen 'em go
I've heared the song, I've seen the show
Now still young yet feeling old
Now I ain't ready for the so called fields of gold
Listen

I fell in love a million times

[Chorus]
But man I still don't know
What i wanna be when I grow up
I don't wanna be a moneymaker
Never wanna be untrue
I wanna be just like you

[Verse 2]
Right, so maybe I can train my left brain a bit
Whenever people talk smart I can say some shit
Like some amazing shit
Maybe I should get into the sales bizz and make mills like my neighbour did

I'll be that big shot calculating
How much he be worth today
Drown in papers, no mistaking
Count a life away

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I've seen 'em coming, I seen 'em go
I heared the song, I seen the show
Now still young yet feeling old
I've got some dreams to live before you see me go
Now listen

I been on national tv

[Chorus]
But man I still don't know
What i wanna be when I grow up
I don't wanna be a moneymaker
Never wanna be untrue
I wanna be just like you

[Bridge]
I wrote bars, they set me free
I own a car with leather seats
I've seen crowds of thousands, waving, jumping
They screamed our name, and we played them something
Pretty girls, they seen my bed
And when they leave I never weep for that no
I shook the hand of the queen and still
I've got some dreams to live and I don't need regrets

[Chorus]
But man I still don't know
What i wanna be when I grow up
I don't wanna be a moneymaker
Never wanna be untrue
I wanna be just like you
But man I still don't know
What i wanna be when I grow up
I don't wanna be a moneymaker
Never wanna be untrue
I wanna be just like you
But man I still don't know
What i wanna be when I grow up
I don't wanna be a moneymaker
Never wanna be untrue
I wanna be just like you

[Outro]
I wanna be just like you
I wanna be just like you
I wanna be just like you




 It's kinda like that every night that i
Close my eyes i know it's time for my big suprise
U hidin at daylight but shinin at night like a streetlight
Like a streetlight...
Reaches my eyesight
But yo it's somthin in the air i just can't describe
Somthin that i can't understand and why
Is u gone everytime that i open my eyes
Cus it's all my fantasy
That makes it so much better baby can't u see
Try to do ye best to remember me
I'll do my best to forget you're a fantasy
And it's gettin pretty difficult to get you out my brain
And if i ever let that happen then I'ma never be the same
Share the sunshine with me, share the rain
Share it all before we enter the day
I know deep down that somthin isn't right
It's the magic of the night
Your name is written on my soul but
I only meet you when i go to sleep
Now will it ever be?
Will it ever be reality
Cus what the hell does it matter if I just keep tellin
Myself that we together whether that's in my head
Or whatever just forget them facts, try to relax
Your picture in my head that i can't neglect
I can't reject, that's why i won't accept
That ur a dream and fake scene, babe either way
If that's true then i'll just, dream all day
Close my eyes, let it go, let you lead my way
Cus girl, ye so divine
And i'm thinkin will it ever end, over time
Cus it's that weird contradiction, of wrong and fine
I'm thinkin: fine, forget wrong, all the time!!
I know deep down that somthin isn't right
It's the magic of the night
Your name is written on my soul but
I only meet you when i go to sleep
Now will it ever be?
Will it ever be reality




 Let's thank life for the inspiration
All the pictures and things you'll see
And I can't stop thinking that it's amazing

All the music and all the silence
And all of them stones turn into diamonds

[instrumental]




 I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you're gone there was never
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
Woahahahah oh, woahahah oh
Woahahahah oh, woahahah oh
Woahahahah
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
Ooooooh ooh oooooh oh ooooooh oh oooooh ooh




 [Verse 1]
Looking down with your toes pressed to the edge
With the sound of your heart beating angry in your chest
I love the way you leap before you look so many times
You were jumping of the cliff with your eyes closed, flying blind
Oh by now we broke our bones and spirits more than twice
And I see you’re so close to lose that sparkle in your eyes
There’s a million voices fighting in your head but you don’t have to listen
And they can break it all down baby but you don’t have to fix it all

[Chorus]
You can try, you can try, you can try again if you want to
You can try, you can try, you can try again if you want to
There’s nothing but cool water down there to catch you
There’s nothing but cool water down there to catch you

[Verse 2]
Slow it down, you’re running nowhere if you’re running on regret
You can try, oh it don’t mean that you can’t free yourself again
I know it seems so bad but it’s just a another frame in the slideshow
So turn the light back on baby, no you don’t wanna miss it all

[Chorus]
You can try, you can try, you can try again if you want to
You can try, you can try, you can try again if you want to
There’s nothing but cool water down there to catch you
There’s nothing but cool water down there to catch you
You can try, you can try, you can try again if you want to
You can try, you can try, you can try again if you want to
There’s nothing but cool water down there to catch you

[Outro]
Falling or flying
We can stay close together
Falling or flying
There’s nothing but cool water down there to catch you
Falling or flying
We can stay close together
Falling or flying
There’s nothing but cool water down there to catch you
Falling or flying
We can stay close together
There’s nothing but cool water down there to catch you




 [Chorus]
Wash away, wash away
Oh, listen to the tales of this old house
A new dawn, a new day, time is on your side
Don't sweat it, don't sweat it no

[Verse 1]
Wash it with the night and
Wash it with the fact that I am
Spitting with the mic in my hand
Cause I have an accidental lack in micstand (he's got an accidental lack of micstand)

Ships they come, they take and bring
And the sea and the wave wash away their sin
But there's no telling about worse or better
For the truth lies deep in the drowned love letter

This time, this place
You can leave everything
There's no wrong in your way
We can be anything

[Chorus]
Wash away, wash away
Oh, listen to the tales of this old house
A new dawn, a new day, time is on your side
Don't sweat it, don't sweat it no

[Verse 2]
Wash it with the dark and wash it with the stars that fall down
You and me are small yeah come down
Hum a little something we be checking out your humsound (hum a little something we be checking out your humsound)

Change of skies, change of tune
Change of pace, yeah maybe soon
But I ain't trading my place
I ain't changing my ways
Whatever step we makin' I be waiting for you to come down

[Pre-Chorus]
But this town, this place, we can be anything

[Chorus]
Wash away, wash away
Oh, listen to the tales of this old house
A new dawn, a new day, time is on your side
Don't sweat it, don't sweat it no

[Post-Chorus]
Don't worry 'bout the home
It's just somewhere to lay
Don't worry 'bout the bed
It's just somewhere to play
Don't worry 'bout it all
Cause I love 'ye today
Yeah, wash away

[Bridge]
Step inside let it fly leave it behind
Yeah we gonna let it die give the mind reason to smile again
Wash away come with me discover the sky, discover the sky, discover the sky
Step inside let it fly leave it behind
Yeah we gonna let it die give the mind reason to smile again
Wash away come with me discover the sky
Uncover ye eyes babe uncover ye eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
But this town, this place, we can be anything

[Chorus]
Wash away, wash away
Oh, listen to the tales of this old house
A new dawn, a new day, time is on your side
Don't sweat it, don't sweat it no

[Post-Chorus]
Don't worry 'bout the home
It's just somewhere to lay
Don't worry 'bout the bed
It's just somewhere to play
Don't worry 'bout it all
Cause I love 'ye today
Yeah, wash away
