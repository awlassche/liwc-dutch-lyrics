Time flies and it seems to me
The older ones get the history
I'll Walk anywhere I like, thanks for the fight
How kind of you bye bye

She said, I know where you will be tomorrow
I said, that's quite bizar, 'cause I don't know where I'll go

So tell me where I'll be, in 2014
The fields or maybe down in the canteen
Living the dream, living the dream

Young gilrs and they seem to me much older than their givin age, you see
There's less than meets the eye
The spirit's gone, feel free to live, 'n bye bye

She said, I know where you will be tomorrow
I said, that's quite bizar, 'cause I don't know where I'll go

So tell me where I'll be, in 2014
The fields or maybe down in the canteen
Living the dream, living the dream

So tell me where I'll be, in 2014
The fields or maybe down in the canteen
Living the dream, living the dream




 3am fully awake
In my head all still is buzzing
Waiting for the sleep to come
No way my friend I'm not even dosing
Every tune I ever heard wants to settle in my brain
I do my best to keep them out
Talk about a lost cause

Insomnia is locked in all of our eyes and we smile, we smile
Music is gasoline so we accelerate
We're living our lives at ninety miles an hour, an hour
We're back where we belong, so we celebrate, celebrate

I'm lying waisted on my ass
Walked a hundred miles to see Foo Fighters and Supergrass
But they'd all started without me
Six Flags circling on the hill
Hey there goes Paulie with a friend
Soul Coughing in the other tent
I think it's time to join them

Insomnia is locked in all of our eyes and we smile, we smile
The music is gasoline so we accelerate
We're living our lives at ninety miles an hour, an hour
We're back where we belong, so we celebrate
I say we celebrate, we just celebrate

Little day-glow pieces off
All my thoughts are in the daytime
There are much more than enough
Feel my shut eyed as they shine
Try to see things positive
Cause if I would have been asleep now
I would never ever have written all these words down

Insomnia is locked in all of our eyes and we smile, we smile
Music is gasoline so we accelerate
We're living our lives at ninety miles an hour, an hour
We're back where we belong - so we celebrate
Oh yeah we celebrate, I say we celebrate




 [Verse 1]
Life's like a dance, there's no second chance
When you drop and fall down on your ass
The judge, of course, has no remorse
Turns out you're not the best

[Chorus]
But you almost made it
You almost got out alright
You almost made it
You almost got out alive


[Verse 2]
Nothing's supposed to be like those old days
Our memories must suffice
One day we die, most days we don't
Let's drag life by the hair

[Chorus]
And we almost made it
We almost got out alright
We almost made it
We almost got out alive

[Verse 3]
One thing is true, if it's not for you
Then I'd care for nothing at all
You can't go wrong if you stay headstrong
Do things you want

[Chorus]
Oh, you almost made it
You almost got out alright
Almost made it
You almost got out alive
Almost made it
And you've almost got out alright
Almost made it
You've almost got out alive




 Summer turned it's back too soon
Now we're playing autumn tunes again
As we're waiting in this dressingroom
The backstage door is closed but it will open soon
People grey and dusty minds
I feel like running down the hill hoping to settle there
But running's just a waste of time
You see, the more we run the more we seem to get nowhere

Today I had a strange feeling
It started off so well you say
Today I had a strange feeling
It started off so well but it went slowly down the drain

Cuddle in your moodswing season. Role around in selfpity there
Go ahead cry without a reason. Don't believe I don't care

It's so funny how it turned out she said
You see the winter always makes me grab for cigarettes
Both my shoes are full of led
From now on things can only jolly up I guess

Chorus

Maybe it's true
Bullshit stories people tell about me, they're all true
Well today's over. Tomorrow's coming through




 Sometimes the world is an ending
And sometimes there's a hell to pay
When all your so-called friends just leave you
And all that's to blame seems to be you
Then I'll back you up at least i'll try to do so

When all that you see is a darkness
And all that you fear is so real
When memories haunt you when sleeping
And they're stabbing your stomach
I won't let you fall, cause I'll back you up

Chorus:
When somebody knocks you down, some other will pick you up
When somebody knocks you down
Some won't be there when you need them
While others will save you from harm
Some promise the world
If you give them your world
Well I hope that you know me by now

Sometimes you break expectations
It's like slapping them all in the face
Sometimes you choose your own answers
Forgetting the ones that all others say
Then I'll still back you up

Chorus

Sometimes the world is an ending
And sometimes there's a hell to pay




 Bedroom floor

Waking up on a bedroom floor
I don't remember this no more
Dirty stains on a bedroom floor
I don't remember whose for sure

Took a dive, got away with it
Even the best can drown in it
Took a dive, got away with it
Even the best can drown in it

Living in this man made hell
That is if he'd live to tell
They blame the ones that knew him well

Guess the cameras couldn't tell

He had it all but he wanted more
Took a gun and went for war
Turn into something you won't like
And he won't apologize

Living in this man made hell
That is if he'd live to tell
They blame the ones that knew him well
Guess the camera's couldn't tell

It ain't pretty dear
But it's necessary
It ain't pretty dear




 Before you leave me now
Tell me where the hell
I am Before you're taken down
Won't you tell me once again
Before you get the chance
Don’t take away my memories
Before you leave me now

Before you leave me now
Tell me where I’m gonna go If
I start walking now
Then the sooner I will know
Before I get the chance
To take it out on you again
Before you leave me now

'Cause your life’s been vinegar on ice
Now you‘re leaving
Just before you say goodbye
Believe me, believe when I
Say that I’ll miss you
Please believe when I
Say that I’ll miss you

I miss you

Before you leave me now
Tell me you will be alright
That there’s not much to say
And all you know is that it’s time
Before I lose the chance
To say goodbye to you again
Before you leave me now

I won't ask you to stay anymore
Now you're leaving
But just before you shut the door
Won't you believe me, believe when I
Say that I’ll miss you
Please believe when I
Say that I’ll miss you
When I say that I’ll miss you
I say that I’ll miss you

I miss you




 Where the streets are paved
With chewing gum and beer
Where the wisest of men
Are the men you don't ever see around here
Where the aftershave is killing every taste
Where the women forgot
What they got all dressed up for in the very first place

And when all that you need
Is just a little room to breathe
When you dance this thin, thin line
Oh man, you better be kind

And you better be kind
Or stop wasting, wasting my time
And you better be kind

At the age you're sixteen, you feeling wise and old
And the streets of your dreams
Seem to be paved with sex and gold
Where the booze makes fools, feels so lion strong
When the morning time drops all it's
Here you go's, down, oh man, what have I done

And when all that you need
Is just a little room to breathe
When the best that you can
Doesn't cut it for them
When all that you see
Is what they want you to see
When you dance this thin, thin line
Oh man, you better be kind

You better be kind
Or stop wasting, wasting my time
And you better be kind
Ooh, you better be kind




 I never meant to stalk or haunt you or to follow
But without you my life would suddenly go dull
(dumb dumb doll)

Got all your posters man, I hung 'em in my hallway
So where ever you may be, you're always here with me

I've got you underneath my skin
I don't know where I should begin

I'll always be your biggest fan
But you don't know who I am
One day you'll know me man
One day you'll understand
That I'll be your biggest fan

Got seven setlists and I even got two t-shirts
I'm looking prettier than yesterday
One t-shirt's made by hand, the other one is paid for
And man, I promise I won't download anything

Chorus

I have travelled 'cross the land
Dying to see the band
I'll make you understand
I'm much more than a fan
I've travelled 'cross the land
And just to see the band
And guess what. Here I am




 Blow your tears into my face
Sadness is for later times
My angel

And don't be sad my little one
Life has only just begun

I'd be gladly in your shoes
Who'd believe I'd sing the blues
For you?

CHORUS
Don't have to run
Don't have to hide
Someone's outside, and he's waiting

And that'll be...

So blow your tears into my face
Sadness is for later times

And every time I look at you
I believe this was for you, yeah

The sound of moonlight you can hear
The song of trees are singing too
Oh yeah they're for you

CHORUS

So what can I
Do to make you happy
When the words don't do the trick
Being silent as you're crying isn't it
So what can I
Do to make you happy
When the words don't mean a thing
Being silent as you're crying isn't me

You'll never be me, hmmmm, hmmmm

Blow your tears into my face
Sadness is for later times
My angel

And don't be sad my little one
Because life has only just begun

CHORUS

And that'll be me...




 [Verse 1]
All broken down and shut-eyed, dangers down the road
People's tricky business, turn to overload
Don't remember clearly, it's blank behind the eye
I caught up with the memory, I never said goodbye
I never said goodbye

I remember faces behind the wall of yours
And I remember fistfights until one of us dropped
I don't recall all details, some are better off
I wish that it was possible to review the best of

[Pre-Chorus]
Day by day it hits in
Thanks for all you did in the blue days
Bit by bit it hits in, and
Thanks for all you did in the blue days

[Chorus]
I gotta try al little more
Because I'm an asshole, but I'm learning
I gotta try a little more
I'm an asshole, but I'm learning
Yeah I'm learning

[Verse 2]
This is a picture of us all, standing in the hallway
Looking quite ridiculous, a little overdressed
You never understood, I had to take this call
Because without dreams there's nothing left at all

[Pre-Chorus]
Day by day it hits in
Thanks for all you did in the blue days
Bit by bit it hits in
Thanks for all you did in the blue days

[Chorus]
You got to try a little more
'Cause you're an asshole, but you're learning
You got to try a little more
You're still an asshole, but you're learning
You're still learning

[Bridge]
Broken down and shut-eyed, dangers down the road
You say I took a sideway, you say I broke the oath
I don't remember clearly, it's blank behind the eye
I caught up with the memory, I never said goodbye




 [Verse 1]
I take your hand
Like a bottle of waiting whiskey
I build my plans
From a bottle of waiting whiskey

[Chorus]
Well, as soon as I drink it down
I know I'll fall behind
Cause the woman by my side
Worth more than a thousand of your kind
A thousand of your kind

[Verse 2]
You go your way
Is better than my way anyway
If I fall, stand up again and say
What if I leave of your life finally

[Chorus]
And as soon as I drink it down
I know I'll fall behind
Cause the woman by my side
Worth more than a thousand of their kind

[Post-Chorus]
[?] that fear of longing
Go on and leave all the doubt behind
It's not what you need but what you wanted
Steam keeps on building up inside
When daytime ends, here comes the night

[Verse 3]
I crave your hand
Like a bottle of waiting whiskey
Yeah I crave, but I don't even understand
What the hell is wrong, what the hell is wrong with me
And as soon as I give in
I know I'll lose [?]
As the guilt will leave a scar upon my soul

[Post-Chorus]
So [?] that fear of longing
You go on and leave all the doubt behind
Cause it's not what you need but what you wanted
Steam keeps on building up inside
When daytime ends, here comes the night
When daytime ends, here comes the night




 And the boy broke her heart
And her heart broke by boy
Thrown back to the start
Thrown out like a toy
So the girl she ran off
And her dad was afraid
'Cause his laughter in life
It was taken away

Away

Her dad couldn't take
That he's girl felt alone
He knew 'bout the boy
And drove straight to his home
Went up to the roof
Played God for one night
No blood on his hands
No blood and no proof

Put your hands on my heart
Please take it all away
From me
'Cause it's so heavy this heart
Please take it all away

Look in my eyes
Can you tell me the truth?
Can you see what disguises
Live hiden beneath?
It's all in my face
And there is no excuse
Please say there's no need
'cause there is no proof

Put your hands on my heart
Please take it all away
From me
It's so heavy this heart
Please take it all away

And the boy breaks her heart
And the girl fades away
She's falling apart
Yeah she's losing her ways
She is weary and drowsy
Just like in the movies
Nothing that pleases
Man, life should be groovy
Well the boy fell apart
And the girl lost her way
The police at that door
It's too much for one day
You play what you can
You duck and avoid
She'd give everything
Just to fill up the void
The girl's locked away
In her castle of clay
Her father's afraid
'Cause his girls gone away

Away

She's gone away

Away
Away
Away

Put your hands on my heart
Please take it all away
It's so heavy this heart
Please take it all away
Just take it away

Away
Away
Away

Away
Away
Away




 [Verse 1]
Brick by brick
We built a house
And then we broke it down
Word for word we meant to hurt
And then we killed the sound
Well it starts with a joke
And then it goes up in smoke
And leaves us wondering how
And no one knows that's all she wrote
Well at least for now

[Chorus]
We're building a fire
Warm up in it's arms
The tears are like diamonds
Nothing here's ever good enough for ya
We're building a fire
Warm up in it's arms
Flames are the liars
Cause nothing here's ever good enough
Nothing here's ever good enough, for love

[Verse 2]
And brick by brick
We build a house
In this crazy town
And word for word you make love or get hurt
Yeah I won't back down
And it starts with a kiss
Did it end up like this
Shit I'm running round
It goes to show you never will know
What life's about, what life's about

[Chorus]
We're building a fire
Warm up in it's arms
The tears are like diamonds
Nothing here's ever good enough for ya
We're building a fire
Warm up in it's arms
Flames are the liars
There's nothing here

[Bridge]
Stone by stone we make a home
Just to stroll around, maybe for a while
Close together and still alone
It's quite the life or quite a lie
Oh we're building a wall right before our eyes
Close together and still alone

[Outro]
Building a fire
To warm up in it's arms
Tears are like diamonds
Cause nothing here's ever good enough for ya
We're building a fire
Warm up in it's arms
Flames are the liars
Nothing here is ever good enough for ya
Building a fire here
We warm up in it's arms
Tears are like diamonds
Nothing here's ever good enough
Nothing here's ever good enough for love
Nothing here's ever good enough, good enough for love




 [Verse 1]
Sitting on top of his shoulders  where no one could get to me
Living life to the fullest without hurting anyone that doesn't need to be
A piece of my old man's advice
Don't ever drown in the blues, my son
It's time to pick up the fight and do all that needs to be done

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe one of all these days we'll all be older
One of all these days we'll do what is right
Until that day comes, man, you bring it on

[Chorus]
Bring it on, man, 'cause I ain't scared of you
So bring it on
Yeah bring it on, man, 'cause I ain't scared of you
I ain't scared of you

[Verse 2]
You've still got the love pouring through every bone in your body
I can't teach you how to live but I can give you pointers alright
You don't need to be big
You don't need to be strong
Just know when they hit and when they run, my son
Just being brave doesn't mean that being scared is always, always wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe one of all these days we'll all be older
One of all these days we'll be singing along
Sing along with bring it on

[Chorus]
So bring it on, man, 'cause I ain't scared of you
So bring it on
So bring it on, man, 'cause I ain't scared of you
So bring it on
You bring it on
So bring it on, man, 'cause I'm not scared of you
Oh no, I ain't scared of you




 [Verse 1]
It's 4 o'clock, the rain has stopped
He's in too deep, he ran out of luck
Nowhere he can go
And his old friends, they left the spot
Because of the little time he's got
Not that they ever warned him though

[Chorus]
If you can't give her space
We're afraid it's too late
You got to let her go now
Or we can't help you, brother

[Verse 2]
All he thinks: the love is gone
The broken-hearted, they must be strong
You still got us
Well there's this yearning in the stomach
Pain and doubt by why she done it
And pride that tells him to shut up

[Chorus]
If you can't give her space
We're afraid it's too late
You got to let her go now
Or we can't help you, brother

And if you're willing to fight
Then you'll make it alright
You just got to let her go now
Or we can't help you, brother




 Oh, It's Saturday, all right
Bring some beers and come on over
The latest Ben Folds Five
Right by your side
We're a team, you know
And I'll never let you go
You can pick a hundred fights
I'm right by your side
Right by your side

Chorus:
Half past wrong, talking way too much tonight
Sip another one with your favourite 'likie dies'
Smell the air, I swear it wasn't me now this time
We're gonna be, we're gonna be around 'till monkeys fly
Oehh, 'till they fly baby

I know that I ain't easy
It's difficult to please me
But you proved more than all right
Right by my side
You may mess up my hair
Torch it, shave it, I don't care
Because morale never dies when I'm right by your side
Right by your side

Chorus:
Half past wrong, talking way too much tonight
Sip another one with your favourite 'likie dies'
Smell the air, I swear it wasn't me now this time
We're gonna be, we're gonna be around 'till monkeys fly
Ohh, untill they fly..

Bridge:
Because when I look around and I found out things ain't going right
I just smile and figure what the hell, just stick it in your pocket
Because all is fine and I'm all right
Smile a while and I see the light
And I find out everything's just fine
Right by your side

Chorus:
Half past wrong, talking way too much tonight
Sip another one with your favourite 'likie dies'
Smell the air I swear it wasn't me now this time
We're gonna be around 'till monkeys..
Sit right up and sing along with every little part of this song
Smile upon a rainy day, because you know it ain't to stay
And everything will be just fine, because in time the sun will shine
And I'll be by your side
Oh yeah




 Strange affliction's watching over
My hangover can't be sold
Strange addictions become a part of me in here

But you don't owe me anything
You don't owe me shit in life
Still the talk never comes alone
When I told her she'd be waiting life as long as she lasts life living so

Boredom died too easily in your head thanks to my hands
Now you're searching more than that change
But I ain't bitter anymore

But you don't owe me anything
You don't owe me shit in life
Still the talk never comes alone
And I told her she'd be waiting life as long as she lasts life living so

Strange afflictions is watching over
My hangovers can't be sold
Oh but I'm hoping 'cause I'm coping fine today

My affliction's marching in
Everything I held for right is moving
Straight the other way

So you don't owe me anything
You don't owe me shit in life
Still the talk never comes alone
And I told her she'll be waiting life as long as she lasts life living so
Man I told her she'd be waiting life as long as she lasts life living so




 There's a big numb stare
Coming off of his face
She's laughing at the smoke
That's coming out of his face
But this fool lives on the hill
And she don't like to pay the bills
But she will

There's a lot of talk about her
Behind her back
She's good enough to need
But never to respect
They call her what they will
But when they're done they pay the bill
They pay the bill

No more feeling
She don't want it, she don't need it
She will distance herself from feeling
‘Cause she don't need a better reason
No reason to hold back

Oh jenny

Well there's husbands and there's lawyers
And there's factory employees
And there's counsellours and mayors
With their presidential stares
There are lonely ones and liars
Looking for a way to buy her
And she don't care

No more feeling
She don't want it, she don't need it
She will distance herself from feeling
She showers up and man believe me
She'll be clean again

Clean again
Jennifer’s up and running
Working for the Fatman
Jenny’s in for anything
As long as her kids are eating
Pay up she'll make you smile
Pay up she'll make you smile, smile

Strange ideas, what am I doing here
She's not familiar with this talk
They're only looking at her rear
You can call her what you will
Angie, Rose or even Bill Hell, what you will

All the husbands, all the lawyers
All the factory employees
All the counsellours and mayors
Wow, so stunning how they dare
They dare to claim they know it all
The dirty looks they throw
She knows them all

No more feeling
She don't want it, she don't need it
She will distance herself from feeling
She showers up and man believe me
She'll be clean again

Clean again
Jennifer’s up and running
Working for the Fatman
Jenny’s in for anything
As long as her kids are eating
Pay up she'll make you smile
Pay up she'll make you smile, smile

One more filthy memory




 [Verse 1]
Lost the things that you thought you would never miss
Let them out, miss them while they're gone
But there's memories down here that'll always live
And they can't take them away, so they won't

[Bridge]
Open this window, let the sickness out
Sleep softly and breath again
If there's a way then it'll find you, and help you out
You're like a circle, there's no start and no end

[Chorus]
Close your eyes, you might see something beautiful
Cause it's not all pitch black in the back of your mind
So close your eyes, you might see something prettier
You pick a dream right out of the night

[Verse 2]
And change I wish, for I will, cause it's gonna work
You can do this, it's your life
And if you're unhappy about something, stop jerking about
Follow the cloud and dive right in

[Bridge]
Open this window, just let the wind blow in
And let it grab ya and calm you down
And if there is no way to find a way
But don't go down the easy way
And don't let any of them bastards hold you down

[Chorus]
Close your eyes, you might see something beautiful
Cause it's not all pitch black in the back of your mind
So close your eyes, you might see something prettier
So pick a dream right, out of the night

[Verse 3]
Welcome to the show
Cause you're following the man, with a million dollar plan
And all the dreams are gone if you let 'em go
Yeah all the dreams you win, if you dare to make it so
If you dare to make it so

[Verse 4]
You lost the things that you thought you would never miss
You let them out, and miss them while they're gone
But there's memories down here, and they will always live down here
No they can't take them away, so they won't

[Chorus]
Close your eyes, you might see something beautiful
Cause it's not all pitch black in the back of your mind
So close your eyes, you might see something prettier
You pick a dream right out of the night

So close your eyes
You close your eyes
So close your eyes
Come on close your eyes




 Just a couple of guys
From my neighbourhood
They put their heads together
And they told me their plan
It was no good
But I was young so it didn't matter
When they told me to run
I ran as fast as I could
I wasn't fast enough however
And I laughed as I fell
I was still feeling good
I felt alive that's all that mattered

I was in for the fun, I put my soul into it
In for the fun, I put my soul into it
In for the fun, 'cause no one else would do it

I'd do it again
I got no regrets
I'd do it again
I never win
But I'll do it again
I got no regrets
Do it again

Just a couple of girls
Suppose they were friends
Not that I'm sure about it
I was brought to a house
When I awoke I was there
And I was naked to the bone
Now I'm back in my pants
And I do understand
I need to slow down a little
I learned to choose what I see
What I do, and believe
With wrong and right still in the middle

Yeah I'm still in for the fun, I put my soul into it
I'm in for the fun, I put my soul into it
In for the fun, when no one else will do it

I'd do it again
I got no regrets
I'd do it again
And never win
But I'll do it again
I got no regrets
Do it again

Yeah let's do it again
You'll see me laughing out loud when I do it again
Let's do it again
You'll see me laughing out loud when I do it again




 I don't know how to get up early
A church bell for alarm is simply not enough
I'm scared to lose the dreamy moment
So when I get the chance I shut if off

The dream I dreamt is fading slowly
All I know is that I lost a fight
Well I'm still tired, like I've been working
It's like I live another life at night
Just getting up to drink my coffee
I walk towards the toilet do my thing
The mailman's late, repeats the story
Shit, he's earlier than yesterday

Somehow it seems cut up now
Twisted views on daily news and all
The tube is watching you now
So turn it off and shake it off now

Daily news does nothing new
So you read your horoscope just to verify they're lying
Turn the page in search for some white space
Deserts or snow valleys would be fine
There's no joy; no one is dancing
Daily news' power makes me cry
So what's the use of making chances
Why don't we all smile our daisy smiles?

Somehow it seems cut up now
Twisted views on daily news and all
The tube is watching you now
So turn it off and shake it off now

Somehow it seems cut up now
Twisted views on daily news and all
The tube is watching you now
So turn it off and shake it off now

I'm looking for a smile
I'm looking for a reason why
Because it seems so long ago that people smiled their daisy smiles

Somehow it seems cut up now
Twisted views on daily news and all
The tube is watching you now
So turn it off and shake it off now

Somehow it seems cut up now
Twisted views on daily news and all
The tube is watching you now
So turn it off and shake it off




 Last night I swore
I was doing much better
Last night I dreamt that I was wearing this sweater
It was my favourite one and I wore it all the time
But you threw it out just like this heart of mine
I'm down up, I'm up and down
You tied me up and dragged me al threw town
'Cause good love is hard to find
But you would sell it just to buy some time

I don't believe you anymore
I don't believe you anymore
You just go with the flow till you think there's a
Better way
I don't believe you anymore

So go on, and hurt another one
You go on, kid the moon and the Sun
You go on, having endless fun
You laugh and do it then you cry that it's done

I don't believe you anymore
I don't believe you anymore
You just go with the flow till you think there's a
Better way
I don't believe you anymore

Oh I don't believe you anymore
I don't believe you anymore
You just go with the flow till you think there's a
Better way
I don't believe you anymore




 [Verse 1]
Please don't give up the fight
For no reason, but your own
I never said that the fight would be easy
Because it won't
I will remember you, and all that we' been through
There is no angel, that can be more angel than you
I see you every night, when your star is shining bright
And I cry, and I smile I wish you where here, with me

[Chorus]
Well, I am so proud to be your father
I'm so proud to be your mom
And I am so proud to be your brother
So may this be your song

[Verse 2]
Please don't give up the fight
For no reason, but your own
Cause I never said the fight would be easy
Because it won't
I will come look for you
When this life is through, with this body
Before now I still need to live
For we are not alone, and you are not alone
We're at home, loving and waiting
And so afraid

[Chorus]
Well, I am so proud to be your father
So proud to be your mom
And I'll always be proud to be your brother
So may this be your song
Please don't give up the fight for no reason




 You can tell me to breathe
What to say when I talk
Climb on my back
You slide down my neck
And use my face for a walk

You can tell me to smile
You can make things worthwhile
Need slap as I cry
Probably laugh as I try
To figure out what you're smiling about

[Chorus]
Send me straight off to hell
To find a story to tell
And you know that I will
Make my life worth my while
Give me a reason to smile
And you better hurry
And I hope that you will

[Bridge]
But don't ever hold me down
But don't ever hold me down

Choose your life, it's your choice
To fall asleep with the noise
Yell at me and the guys
When it's been one of those nights
You're probably right

Oh, when you open your mouth
The pretty words that roll out
You point your finger at me
You've seen the words that can be
I hope you know what that means

[Chorus]
Send me straight of to hell
To find a story to tell
And you know that I will
Make my life worth my while
Give me a reason to smile
And you better hurry
And I hope that you will

[Bridge]
But don't ever hold me down
But don't ever hold me down

Not the talkative kind
And yesterday is behind
And I believe that it's better that way
You send me straight of to hell
To find a story to tell
For you to go there
And you know that I will

But don't you step on my brain
It drives a man insane
And it's nothing to be laughing about
I got nothing to prove
I'll be the fool for you
If there's anything
I'll help you out

[Bridge & outro]
But don't you ever hold me down
Don't you ever hold me down
You've got, you've got nothing to hold me down
Don't ever hold me down




 Looking for a feeling
Well I haven't got a damn idea where to find
Looking and I'm dreaming
But I haven't got a clue, a clue what to find
Tell me that I'm stealing
But I never stole anything, that's a lie
Looking at the ceiling
I'm still trying to breath and I'm trying to give a
Fuck

Believe me, this time runs out when you run on luck
Don't drop, believe me
When you're running on edge
Yeah don't you dare to give up, yeah

Yeah
I won't dare

So this has no meaning
But you're dropping the fact that there's something
Cool about it
Giving us a reason
To play what we like and not to do the hair
Seeing is believing
But we showed you a lot but you wouldn't believe it and

Hey
Kinda lost the feeling
You were stealing the stuff that we thought that we
Just paid off

Believe me, this time runs out when you run on luck
Don't drop, believe me
When you're running on edge
Yeah don't you dare to give up, yeah

Hey man, what are you crying for
Hey man, what are you crying for

Don't stop
Believe me, this time runs out when you run on luck
Don't drop, believe me
When you're running on edge
Yeah don't you dare to give up

Don't stop
Believe me, this time runs out when you run on luck
Don't drop, believe me, when you're running on edge
Yeah don't you dare to give up
When you're running on edge
Don't you dare to give up, yeah




 Let's stay in bed, no better yet
Take my bike and go outside
'Cause if! don't and stay inside
Then I know I'll lose my mind

Thought I was dead, buried and left
All! did was take a breather
Tied to the bed so I could stay out of trouble for a day
Yeah right, no way

This is home, this is roots
This is where you're understood
Take your bike and leave the car
Going straight to Eric's Bar

'You're on your own' was on the phone
It's too hot to stay inside, he said
So get your shorts and find a smile
Let's go grab a beer a while, just for a while

We ramble on, humming a song, we don't mean to hurt no one
We blow our nose in the dresscodes
They don't even see us run with our worn-out sneakers on

Take a dive, skinny dip, it's okay to lose your grip
Feel the breeze, cool the brew, giving Kimberley the lip

You never have to lie, never have to fake
Never lose your fun, never have to hide away
These people know you well, they will not kiss and tell
Never have to run, never have to run and hide

Chorus




 Yeah
I'm walking home after drinking all my pennies
So now I've got a beatbox in my head
Probably seems funny to you honey, bunny
Well it ain't and when I'm home I'm going straight to bed. WOW

Walking home and I haven't got a planny
Because of all the pennies in my head
Well I'm pretty flip; and I'm losing grip rocksteady, Betty
Pretty fly but I'm all right. I don't need a cigarette, 'cause I

Feel like flying. Woow, damn right! I feel like flying
I've got a rotor on my head
And I feel like flying. Yep
Oh I feel like flying

I told a girl her name was pretty silly
She spit me in the face and stole my chair
Hell I just grinned and I said my name was silly looking Billy
And after that my memory kinda stopped right there

Soulful feeling feels like smiling. Soulful smiling feels like...

Feel like flying. woow I feel like flying
I've got a rotor on my head
And I feel like flying. Yeah I feel like flying
I'll fly, I'll fly

Falling back in zero conversation
Because besides me there's no one else around
Me, myself and I were on a holiday probation
A dazzle sound awakes me as I walk straight out of town

Walking home as the words role down my tongue straight to below
I just catch them right before they hit the ground
Well I was walking home as the words rolled down my tongue straight to below
I just catch them right before they hit the ground you know you know

Soulful feeling feels like smiling. Soulful smiling feels like...

I feel like flying. Yeah
I feel like flying, I've got a rotor on my head
And I feel like flying. Yeah
Still feel like flying
So I'll fly ...




 You got me thinking
I'm really thinking
Don't want a palace, just a roof
You tend to melt, I'm waterproof

You got me thinking
I'm merely thinking
You wanna drop, make sure you bounce
You need a little don't take an ounce

The book we're living in
I read it twice
And I don't want the plot to change

Although it's beautiful
And you are lovely
Still I'll be damned if I let you take my

Freedom, freedom
Freedom, freedom

You got me thinking
Yeah, I'm merely thinking
You wanna grow, you'll have to learn
To put it out, it has to burn

How am I gonna tell you stuff
That I don't know myself
You need a minute, don't take an hour
I'll drink the milk, but not when it's sour

This book we're living in
I've read it twice
And I don't want the plot to change

Although it's beautiful
And you are lovely
Still I'll be damned if I let you take my

Freedom, freedom
Freedom, freedom

This book we're living in
I've read it twice
And I don't want the plot to change

Although it's beautiful
And you are lovely
Still I'll be damned if I let you take my

Freedom, freedom
Freedom, freedom




 [Verse 1]
Here's to the friends we used to have
That slipped away like they we're never there
Look at the picture in my hand
And feel the memories return
Flyin' in from everywhere

[Chorus]
Yeah the fun we had
What a life we've lived
Looking for all those pieces left on memory lane
Yeah the fun we had
Yeah the fun we had

[Verse 2]
And here's to times when things went bad
Drink up sunny boys, we made it home
Please know I never Will forget
All of the fun we had and how I never felt alone

[Chorus]
Oh the fun we had
Yeah, what a life we lived oh
I'm looking for all the pieces left on memory lane
What a fun we had

[Bridge]
There will always be time
No, I'm not afraid to go
But man, you know I hate goodbyes
So if you need a place to run
There will always be a friend to lend a hand
To hold someone until we'll be alright
So cheers to friends we used to have

[Outro]
Yeah, the fun we've had
Oh, the life we've lived
Looking for all these pieces left on memory lane
Oh, what the fun we had yeah
Yeah, the fun we had
What a life we lived
Looking for all these pieces left on memory lane
Yeah, the fun we had




 We call for love and we think that it's romantic
We hear, believe and we never question why
We chew on live without looking for an answer
We stare at the walls and give up before we try

What if love keeps us save
What if love keeps us brave
What if love keeps us save
What if love keeps us save away from home

You call it quits be I don't think that it's even
We're speeding on we run run run out of time
Steppingstones there's always someone to step on
Son stay close to me there's a lot between the lines

So let today go, we both might be dead by tomorrow
We're good and ugly, lets take out the bad as we go
Let today go, we both might be dead by tomorrow
We're good and ugly
Don't wanna let you go
Never let you go alone

We talk to god, we die and prayre in the evening
We talk about of the good or bad we won
I guess people show that beauty is often evil
Son stay close to me I'll show you my right from wrong

And let today go, we both might be dead by tomorrow
We're good and ugly, lets take out the bad as we go
Let today go, we both might be dead by tomorrow
We're good and ugly
Dont wanna let you go
Never let you go alone




 I came down from high places, and I'll be leaving again
When our bit of luck erases, we'll be better of dead
I wish that jealousy was in vain, and we'd all be playing little games
'Cause all these schemes inside keep running 'round in my head

We got the right to play the game
Let the laughter roll insane
Pull a face, an evil eye
'Cause without dreams its's time to die
Hear me out, I tell the truth
I'll be me, if you'll be you
And together we'll be us
There's no why, there's just because
Just because

I brought you absolutely nothing
And I'll leave with nothing too
Only love and only hate, Tell you baby that's the truth
And I don't need nothing in return
Then just hang around with you
There's still so much to offer
But those ain't good for me and you

We got the right to play the game
Let the laughter roll insane
Pull a face, an evil eye
'Cause without dreams its's time to die
Hear me out, I tell the truth
I'll be me, if you'll be you
And together we'll be us
There's no why, there's just because
Oh baby, Just because

Because it was sure so good to see you honey
So good to leave you too
So good to sleep beside you, and to sleep without you too
Yes i came in here with nothing
And I'll leave with nothing too
Yet it turned out to be everything
And my everything's for you

You got the right to play the game
Let the laughter roll insane
Pull a face, an evil eye
'Cause without dreams its's time to die
Hear me out, I tell the truth
I'll be me, if you'll be you
And together we'll be us
There's no why, there's just because
Just because

Hear me out, I tell the truth
I'll be me, if you'll be you
And together we'll be us
There's no why, there's just because
Just because
Oooh baby it's just because




 You get a spoonful shoved down your throat
You need a bomb to burn the cancer out
You're looking restless and fed up like me
So triggered you think I'm an enemy

Listen to both sides
Then make up your mind
I know however you're not gonna try
One side you like
The other you don't know
The grass is greener there, it don't show

We, we got to get out of this place
We, we got to get out of here
We, we got to get out of this place
We, we got to get out of here

Life is a brainload
So take what you need
There's always other ways
And other ways
And better ways
Then grab this hook
Or throw out a line
Luck might just find the time

Let's fight the mills and let's yell at the tide
Call it a foolish game of cats and mice
Live in a nutshell, what a lively idea
OK stay put, while I escape from here

We, we got to get out of this place
We, we got to get out of here
We, we got to get out of this place
We, we got to get out of here
We run out, let me run out
I need to break out of here
I just need to break out

We, we got to get out of this place
We, we got to get out of here
We, we got to get out of this place
We, we got to get out of here
I said we
We need to run
Hide from this place
For a day
We, we got to get out of this place
We, we got to get out of here




 Don't ever look down
On a broken man
Pulls himself up the best he can
Never to reopen the worthless door
Not the way he's done before
And then they all stood to see
They lit the fire
To burn in front of me
The broken man
Must hang down from the tree
And all because they say he's

Guilty, guilty
Oh ladies let me be
Please don't judge me
Don't let me hang
Down from a tree, no

Guilty, guilty
Oh lady let me be
Guilty, guilty
I'm as guilty as can be

All the ladies should have cried
So let them hold
Their tears and lies
Guilty as liars plead
Spreading rumors about me
The bravest fools around
You see
Are the ones neglecting
What they feel
Live to the fullest
Take what you need to steal
The only thing so real

Guilty, guilty
Oh lady let me be
Please don't judge me
Don't let me hang
Down from a tree, no
Guilty, guilty
Oh ladies let me be
Guilty, guilty
I'm as guilty as can be

Oh

Ladies let me live a little

I need to know
A little I can live
I can live
I can live
I can live

So never look down
On a broken man
Pulls himself up
The best he can
Never to reopen the worthless door
It's not the way
You know
You know you're

Guilty, guilty
Sometimes we need to be
Guilty, guilty
Don't let me hang
Down from a tree, no
Guilty, guilty
Sometimes I feel the urge to be
Please don't judge me
Don't let me hang
Down from a tree, no

Guilty, guilty

Guilty, guilty

Guilty, guilty

Guilty, guilty

Oh

Guilty, guilty

Guilty, guilty

Guilty, guilty

Guilty, guilty




 Well I heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do ya?
Well it goes like this
The fourth, the fifth, the minor fall and the major
Lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
And she tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah

(Yeah but) Baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor, (You
Know)
I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah

Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelu...
Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelu...
Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah




 Strangers are talking
Bullshit is walking tonight
Young lovers are breaking
Pretending there's sweat in their eyes
The tears leave no trace in the lights
'cause it's warming her face so she looks all right
You keep on escaping, the X is your alibi

Guilty as charged and you know that you ought to be
So drop the act and the bullshit and keep it real
Take what you like
Here's a great opportunity
You shoot the sheriff, and then shoot the deputy

Young women are dancing
Showing their moves in the light
She's sticky and chewing
Sweaty, I bet sheâ€™s all right
The strangest hand has been dealt by the man on the roof
He was born and held down by choices that Iâ€™ll never choose

You're guilty as charged and you know that you ought to be
So drop the act and the bullshit and keep it real
Take what you like
Here's a great opportunity
You shoot the sheriff
And then shoot the deputy

Shoot the deputy
Let's shoot the deputy
He's hanging with the clowns

Youâ€™re guilty as charged and you know that you ought to be
Soak up the act and the bullshit and keep it real
Take what you like
Here's a great opportunity
You shoot the sheriff
And then shoot the deputy
No I'll shoot the sheriff and you do the deput's wife while
You're at it
A great opportunity
I know you well and you want it as bad as me
Guilty as charged
And you know that we ought to be
Yeah we ought to be
Let's shoot the deputy




 It would be nice if we could all just sleep together
It would be great if we could have a cup of everyting
What'd you do with everyting

It would be lovely, to see all your faces smiling
It would be wonderful if all this shit I sing about
Was happening, was happening, was happening

And it turns out to be with a happy family
But all these families break, everybody's on the take
All that matters today
The kind of money that you make
The money that you make

Yeah all these families break, everybody's on the take
All that matters today
The kind of money that you make
The money that you make

It would be nice if we could all just live together
That's a hand-in-hand situation
It would be great if we could feel a bit of sympathy
Sympathy for you and me

It would be lovely if we all stood up together
It's gotta be like the commercial on tv
It would be wonderful if all this shit I sing about
Was happening, happening, happening

Well it turns out to be with a happy family
But all the families break, everybody's on the take
All that matters today
The kind of money that you make
The money that you make

Yeah all these families break, and everybody's on the take
All that matters today
The kind of money that you make
The money that you make

It would be nice if we could all just sit together
It would be great if we could have a little fun
It would be nice if we could be a happy family today




 I may not have clothes to wear, I may not go anywhere
Just sit on the couch and stare, at nothing
Where is that heroic tune, every time I enter the room
The birds whistle and flowers bloom, why don't they

Maybe I'm just a crazy fool
Who lives by a crazy rule
To bring happy thoughts
Happy thoughts to you

Flowers pop out of the street, everywhere I place my feet
Consisting of all good deeds, like I never lie
Woke up, one of me was gone, pinch harder, what's going on
Who's who, and where's the other one, you follow

Funny how it hurts, funny when the hero has to flee
Funny and absurd, to realize that hero's really me
Funny how it hurts, funny how it seems
Funny how the only joke's on me, something you should know
Heroes come and go, tomorrow I'll be brave, today just me

But I'll be the crazy fool
Who lives by a crazy rule
To bring happy thoughts
Happy thoughts to you

I always will be the crazy fool
Who lives by a crazy rule
To bring happy thoughts
Happy thoughts to you




 These are the words I would say to you
Snap out, wake up you fool
Busy protecting your long lost clue
Which you don't have to choose

These are the things I would say to you
Wake up snap out you fool
You're busy protecting your long lost clue
Which you don't have to choose
You don't have to...

You're still listening to the hardcore tapes you used to play
The backside of your mind still busy with loving it
I don't believe you when you say good songs will die eventually
You're still, you're still, you're still, you're still listening

You're still listening
You just seem to be listening
Yeah well listen a little harder now
And try a little more

Still busy protecting your long lost clue
And there is a light in it for you
You haven't got a clue what you do
Don't you do the things that you like to do

Busy protecting the things that you own
But there is a light going wrong
Just look around you and get it through your things cause
You don't have to choose, you don't have to choose, you don't have to

But you're still listening to the hardcore tapes you used to play
The backside of your mind still busy with loving it
I don't believe you when you say good songs will die eventually
You're still you're still you're still you're still listening

Your listening
You seem to be listening
What the fuck do you think you hear
What do you fear, what do you fear, what do you fear…




 [Verse 1]
And the record's playing on
And the people talk their shit
And the world, it turned out round
With so much crap on it
And I listen to a song
I repeat it once or twice
And as I look into her eyes
I fear a cruel goodbye

[Chorus]
Oh, so I hate to love
I hate to love
Oh, well I hate to love
I just hate to love
Because I don't wanna lose you, my dear

[Verse 2]
We get stuck again between
All the words we wanna scream
And then the silence, it always wins
So we shut up again
And there's no wisdom in the air
And I know words for anything
Only the fear, she's 'bout to break
She can't be fixed again

[Chorus]
Oh, so I hate to love
I hate to love
Oh, well I hate to love
I just hate to love
Because I will lose you, my dear

[Instrumental bridge]

[Chorus]
Oh, I hate to love
I hate to love
Oh, well I hate to love
I hate to love
Because I will lose you, my dear
Oh, because I will lose you, my dear




 Mother you are the one
Who never gave up on me when I was wrong
Stronger, you made me, so
I have to tell you mom I love you before you go

Before you're passing me by, I hope that you've lived the life
May heaven hold a place for those who always lived for rock and roll
Dear mama bye bye

Hey father, I'm kinda scared
There's still so much to do that isn't dared
Father, please hold my hand
I hope we'll meet again the day I land

Before you're passing me by, I hope that you've lived the life
May heaven hold a place for those who always lived for rock and roll
Dear father bye bye

So brothers, you hold on tight
Tell me, are you set for the last ride?
Hey brothers, no we'll never win
But let's play it till the end or the beginning

Before you're passing me by, I hope that you've lived the life
May heaven hold a place for those who always lived for rock and roll
Dear brothers

May heaven hold a place for those who always lived for rock and roll
Dear father

May heaven hold a place for those who always lived for rock and roll
Dear mother bye bye




 You read about it in the paper
You hear about it on the news
The hero's in town
You never know who called him
And there's nothing you can do
The hero's in town
Flying overhead
And he's fixing things as new
The hero's in town
People worship on a daily basis
Before dinner in the afternoon
The hero's in town
Yeah the hero's in town

Sure come in handy
A hero in town
He's offering candy to everyone
Oh what a guy
You better sleep with a gun
The hero is in town

So look up at the sky my friend
Is it safe enough to go out there
The hero's in town
So should we trust or loathe him
Should we break or take his hand
The hero's in town
He's leaning on his golden cane
He gives away free hurricanes
The hero's in town
For god and money devil's fight
Religion holds a beast inside
The hero's in town
Yeah The hero's in town

Sure come in handy
A hero in town
He's offering candy to everyone
What good are heroes in this mixed up world
Load us up another free, free world
Free world
Load us up another free, free world
Free world

Monkey see, monkey do
Monkey wants so it comes straight through
Small talk travels quicker
Than the truth can tie its shoes

Sure come in handy
A hero in town
He's offering candy to everyone
Oh what a guy
You better sleep with a gun
'Cause the hero is in for money
He's in for money




 Take a little minute love, take a little time
To listen to this record love
It's gonna be just fine
It's all about honesty, that won't do you any harm
We're going to work our asses off
It's gonna take a lot of our energy; it's gonna take some time

But this is not a crime, stepping out of line
I won't have peace of mind
Till it's over, till it's perfect and fine

Now a little serious
We're gonne be just fine, a little bit hilarious
Our ass is on the line
A little bit of modesty won't do us any harm
We're gonna work our asses off
It's gonna take a lot of our energy it's gonna take a some time

But this is not a crime, stepping out of line
I won't have peace of mind
Till it's over, till it's perfect and fine

Something in my head tells me to break
It's gonna be all just fine
A little bit hilarious it seems to be I know
But everything will work out fine

Now a little obvious. another chorus line
It's coming in a minute ,it's gonna be just fine
A little bit of modesty won't do us any harm
We're gonna work our asses off
It's gonna take a lot of our energy; it's gonna take some time

But this is not a crime, stepping out of line
I won't have peace of mind
Till it's over, till it's perfect and fine




 Your skin is getting sun-tanned;
I don't want to peel it off today
So pass me the lotion 20
My nose has had enough today

My body, glitter glamour
Upon my towel I slip away
I got to go, I got to go, the sea is calling and

The sun is in my head and it's OK It's an ice cream day (3x)
Sun is in my head

Pass me my sunglasses
You sat on yours I still got mine
Just stretch out your right hand
They're in the plastic bag behind

The stereo Motorpsychos
Just chilling, it's a holiday
Don't turn 'em off don't turn 'em off just let it play because

Their song is in my head and it's OK It's an ice cream day (3x)
Sun is in my head

I sweep my sweaty eyes
Wide open when she's walking by again

Pamela Anderson look-alikes lay naked in the sand
I quickly turn around to dig a bigger hole for my best friend

Again. Summer slips away too fast again
Again. Well eight more days to make them last, make them last

And the sun is in my head and it's OK it's an ice cream day. (3x)
Sun is in my head

 Call me crazy in the head
Call me numb and stupid
A piece of me has snapped because of all that

Some time ago I found clear sight
How can you win if you don't fight?
So I lost ability to cry about it

It's impossible
The more I slip, the more I say that it's impossible
Every time I wake...

I had a dream about a wall that fell and broke the circle
The skies above came crumbling. Shit I'm a poet now
I wasn't scared, because you were there
High up in our favourite tree
Waking up and wondering why it can't be

It's impossible
The more I slip, the more I say that it's impossible
Every time I wake it's you that fades away

And every time again we tried, it blew up in our faces
It's not OK for me to stay
Close the book and go away, just don't stay

Call me crazy in the head
Call me numb and stupid
Call my mother just to verify it

I'm impossible
The more I slip, the more I say that I'm impossible
Every time I wake it's you that fades away

And every time again we tried, it blew up in our faces
It's not OK for me to stay
And every time again we tried, it blew up in our faces
It's not OK for me to stay
And every time again we saw the look in our own faces
Eternity is where we'll see




 Love, love i a verb
Love i a doing word
Fearless on my breath
Gentle impulsion
Shakes me, makes me lighter
Fearless on my breath
Teardrop on the fire
Fearless on my breath
Teardrop on the fire
Fearless on my breath




 Ain't it great I got a lot of cash
My creditcard shines
I'm looking mighty, mighty fine
Supergroove and I'm upperclass
I take a dive in my personal goldmine

I've got my own little goldcard
I spend it all quicker than a kickstart
I look pretty good in make-up
My new clip is gonna get me back on top

Everything's got to be kingsize
I got to make this mine all mine
And everything's got to be kingsize
I got to make this mine

I play the shit that the crowd digs
I play the clown, make a fool out of myself
Anything for attention
I shake my ass, showing my titties
It's been a while since I cared for
Something other than my hardcore ego
Where's my heart
Man I wouldn't know
'cause I turned into one of the musical freakshows

Everything's got to be kingsize
I got to make this mine all mine
And everything's got to be kingsize
I got to make this mine

Oh well, everything's got to be kingsize
I got to make this mine all mine
And everything's got to be kingsize
Yeah, I got to make this mine




 Can you give me solid ground
Cause all my footsteps turn me down
One by one
Can you give me free advice
I don't know if I can
But I'll try to listen
And I can blast friendship to hell
Or I can try to make things better
Believe me that'll make things better
They change the rules when it's my turn
So they can laugh and watch me burn

I can laugh about it
Or I can cry about it
I should ignore the words you say
Cause they can hurt
But won't kill me
They can hurt
But won't kill me

They can hurt but won't kill me

A fist full of the things you love
Life's a quiz so cough it up
Go on and cough it up now
When the future's far away
It's always better then today
And everytime I'm having fun
There's something I'm doing wrong
And all these warning lights are lit
But always after you need it
Yeah well anyway

I can laugh about it
I'd better try to laugh
I can cry about it
You'll never see me cry
I should ignore the words you say
They can hurt
But won't kill me
They can hurt
But won't kill me

They can hurt but won't kill me

So I can laugh about it
Yeah I'd better try to laugh
Or I can cry about it
You know you'll never see me cry
I should ignore the words you say
They can hurt
But won't kill me
Cause they can hurt
But won't kill me
No they won't kill me




 I got myself everyting I need
Peace of heart and my own two feet
Life might bring me more than what I need
Win or losing street

I got myself everything real soon
Looking for a way to sail the moon

Pick life up, take it down high noon
Well, it's just what you choose

Still I'm a little down
I'm down on the upside
A little up, I'm up on the downside
And I know what you need
Well, we'll grow wise when we're old
I hope you know what I need
So let's teach our children what they need
To be taught, to be taught

They say, being young is wasted on the youth
But they'll never find a book that holds the truth
So you keep yourself away from higher notes
This is as low as I can go

While I'm a little down
I'm down on the upside
A little up, I'm up on the downside
But I know what you need
We'll grow wise when we're old
I hope you know what I need
So let's teach our children what they need
To be taught, yeah, to be taught




 Hold on

Put up with you
Put up with me
Put up with all of us
There's enough for everyone
So much to say
So much to sing
So much to die for
Yeah there's enough for everyone

There's so much to do
There's a little time
Well there's so much to do
But there's a little time because
I can't see what's right
And I can't stand the sight
And I can't see what's right
And I can't stand
The sight

Well there's a lot
Do we forgive
There's more then we forget
There's enough for everyone
So if our knowledge is a gift
Why can't we give it back
Because it's hurt in everyone

There's so much to do
There's a little time
Well there's so much to do
But there's a little time because
I can't see what's right
And I can't stand the sight
And I can't see what's right
And I can't stand the sight

What if when we wanna win
We have to give up everything
Simply because having less
Is turning out to be the best
Solids every rich and blind
Cause we can not see the light
The biggest fuckeble of it all
The light is blinding all our sights
All our sights




 Stuck in a van
As far away as I possibly can
Stuck in a mood
So far away that it couldn't be good
My back hurts and it rains
Screw England, screw the young and insane
We travel in vain
The dreams are the same

So look at the heroes in the Liverpool rain
I'll stick by you forever, and do it in vain
You travel the houses, soothing the pain
Putting a smile on my face once again
So look at the heroes in the Liverpool rain
Are we here in vain

Stuck in a van, and to be honest man
Well, I don't give a damn
I'm stuck in this mood, and to be honest again
Well, it kinda feels good
Now my back hurts and it rains
And it rains and it rains
Screw England, well we'll be young and insane
'Cause it's part of the game
And the dreams are the same
Are the same, always the same

So look at the heroes in the Liverpool rain
I'll stick by you forever, and do it in vain
(Oh no never in vain)
You travel the houses, soothing the pain
Putting a smile on my face once again
So look at the heroes in the Liverpool rain
Rain, rain

There's a part of me, there's a part of you
There's a history, to follow, wants to screw
There's a destiny, one for each of you
An obsessiveness that wants to pull us through
Well I've got nothing, a little and a lot
I've got something to share, so much I forgot
Don't know what it means
Oh, the Liverpool I care

So look at the heroes in the Liverpool rain
I'll stick by you forever, and do it in vain
(Oh no never in vain)
You travel the houses, soothing the pain
Putting a smile on my face once again
So look at the heroes in the Liverpool rain
Rain, rain, rain

Yeah, look at the heroes in the Liverpool rain
I'll stick by you forever, didn't do it in vain
You travel the houses, soothing the pain
So look at the hero in the Liverpool rain
The rain (always the rain)




 I guess the party is over now
The drinking stops tonight
It's been fun but it's running late
Oh look at the damage done
I've got a tongue that's thick and dry
My eyes are shattered
I got a mind all set on some kind of Zion
In peace
Tomorrow we will lose another day

Yeah tomorrow we will lose another day

I waste my time like I always have
I'm saving up for the unaccountable
Oh better yet, I'll buy my new shoes now
Hauling ass, before I lose myself another day

I feel like I've done you so much wrong
I'll hide out until this day is gone
I'll fill in the blanks I hear you say
It's OK, I'm lazy, flown away
So please let me go

I'm sure the party is over now
I sit back
And watch it fade away
Fading out myself as well
It's time
Tomorrow we will lose another day

I feel like I've done you so much wrong
I'll hide out until this day is gone
I'll fill in the blanks I hear you say
It's OK, I'm lazy, flown away
Well
I feel like I've done you so much wrong
I'll hide out until this day is gone
I'll fill in the blanks I'm hearing you say
It's OK, I'm lazy, flown away
So please let me go

I'm sure the party is over now
Guess it's gone forever




 Clouds above go sailing by
I found my meaning in this life
Clear white is flying in my eyes
Underneath a blue, blue sky
The waves come rolling in with the tide

I've been away too long
And every day I missed you more
You look like you did before, only prettier
Every day I love you more

All the people rushing by, by, by
Looking for meaning in this life
So used up, and blinded by lies
They're underneath the blue, blue sky
The way they seldom seem to smile
I don't know why

'Cause I've been away too long
And every day I missed you more
You look like you did before
Only prettier
Every day I love you more
I love you more
Every day I love you more, and more

'Cause I've been away too long
And every day I missed you more
You look like you did before, only prettier
And every day I missed you more
And more and more and more and more
I've been away too long
And every day I missed you more
Oh you look like you did before, only prettier
Every day I love you more
I love you more
Every day I love you more




 She called and said, you stuff your letter
Yeah, you can sweet talk all you like
But pretty words, it don't make it better
You let the fire burn all night
Yeah, all night

The front door was open, I left my keys in
Guess I've been lucky all my life
But now she's so fed up with my easiness
I won't get any tonight, oh no

I don't know why I gave my love away
Sure don't know why you took the bait
Maybe the balance leaned towards loving
A bit more than it did to hating me

I apologize for everything
For all the times I've done you wrong
Wrong, wrong, wrong
I gathered all my dreams around you
Hope you'll put them with your own
Where they belong

Ok, ok, ok my lovely
I'll always look for other ways to say, to say
To say you're lovely
I'll always look for better ways to say
I love you anyway
I love you anyway

Ok, ok, ok my lovely
I'll always look for other ways to say, to say
Yeah, to say you're lovely
I'll always look for better ways to say
I love you anyway
I love you anyway
I love you anyway




 It took a lotta years, never got it right from the start
All the little efforts were never too serious
Set a lotta business straight then took it apart
Summer in your eyes won't turn to winter that's obvious

Got a little gift that makes me quite a rich man
I try to make the best of it but I am a lazy guy
If I'd quit, then who'd understand
I ain't too good with words and for a singer I'm way too shy

But you asked for another song that would make you cry
Or smile for that matter, so I had to give it a try

Got a little help from my friends in the band
They wanna help me out though I am a funny guy
It takes one to know one I guess
I might be good with chords but all the rest I'll just have to try

'Cause you asked for another
Song for our little girl
How could we refuse to
Make her name known in this world

A little song to lighten up her mood
A little song to brighten up her day
Such a sweet and happy little girl
Deserves a song to come her way

Come sun or rainy days, please stay
Just as sweet as you are today

Took a lotta years, but I got it right in the end
All the little efforts were never in vain, I know
Got a little song for my sweetest surprise
Her name is Luka, she's asleep on the second floor

So now on to another song that is flying about
Sleep tight baby, know that I'll always be around




 I am a man of constant sorrow
I've seen trouble on my days
I bid farewell to old Kentucky
The place where I was born and raised
The place where I was born and raised
For six long years
I've seen in trouble
Little pleasures have I found
For in this world I'm bound to ramble
I have no friends to help me now
I have no friends to help me now
Well I'm a man, I'm a man
I'm a man of constant sorrow
I'm a man, I'm a man
I'm a man of no tomorrow
I've seen trouble all my days
It's time for goodbyes my old lover
I don't think I'll see you again
For I'm bound to ride that Southern Railroad perhaps I'll die on this train
Perhaps I'll die on this train
Well I'm a man, I'm a man
I'm a man of constant sorrow
I'm a man, I'm a man
I'm a man of no tomorrow
I've seen trouble on my days
You can just bury me in some deep valley
For many years I may lay
Then you may learn to love another
While I'm sleeping now cold in my grave
I'm sleeping cold in my grave
I'm sleeping cold in my grave
Well I'm a man, I'm a man
I'm a man of constant sorrow
I'm a man, I'm a man
I'm a man of no tomorrow
I've seen trouble all my days
I've seen trouble all my days
I've seen trouble all my days




 [Verse 1]
Could you help me, mother, father?
Could you do this thing for me?
I'm alone, nobody bothers
No one's looking out for me
Could you help me, mother, father?
Cause my time is running out
And there's nothing here for no one
Here my heart to hand me down
My heart to hand me down

[Verse 2]
Could you help me, mother, father?
I'm not asking for the truth
I don't need that whole damn package
Just a little more of you
Could you help me, darling sister?
When I'm stuck and all alone
I don't want to be nobody's mister
It's the loneliest of homes

[Chorus]
Oh brother, I need you so
Stuck in this world all alone
I can not get out on my own
No I need you, brother
I need you so
I need you so
I miss my family, I miss my home

[Verse 3]
Can you help me out, my brother?
Could you do this thing for me?
Cause I'm stuck down in the cutter
And there ain't no friend I see
Would you help me, mother, father?
I've became so wisdom proof
Land me a hand, you know you oughta
I'm crying out to you

[Chorus]
My brother, I need you so
Stuck in this world all alone
I can not get out on my own
No I need you, brother
I need you so
Stuck in this world all alone
I can not get out on my own
No I need you, brother
I need you so
I need you so
I miss my family, I miss my home

[Outro]
Did you help me out, my brother?
When I'm cold out on the ground
I'm no stranger to the gutter
And I'm a friend to down and out




 I heard he took your dreams and how
He broke your high heels that made you tall
How he burned your wings and how
He kept on keeping you small

Please Mrs. Angel
Hear me out
Some of us would never
Please Mrs. Angel, don't you know
Some of us, some of us still have a soul

I heard that you failed miserably
In your attempt at beauty queen
To cope with words you've never heard
And affraid of people you've never seen oh

Please Mrs. Angel
Hear me out
Some of us would never
Please Mrs. Angel
This much is true
Some of us would dance with you

How miss fortune treats you right
You say you fell again last night
Time is time, and pride is pride
I'm missing the point, just leave it all behind
Why don't you leave it al behind?

I read a story about your past
So strange how basterds always last
Mister Angel is all they say
The devil he turned out to be oh

Please Mrs. Angel
Hear me out
Some of us would never
Please Mrs. Angel
This much is true
Lot of us, lot of us would dance with you

Oh Mrs. Angel, don't you know
Some of us, still have a soul
Mrs. Angel this much is true
Lot of us, lot of us would dance with you

Well I would like to dance with you




 We got a supermarket and a church
For anyone who’s got the urge
There's a nightclub and a school
Faith, a devil and a god
But more important, there's a bar
We’ve got neighbours with new cars
Brand new cars

Here in my town, my little town
My little town, my town, this is my town
This is my town, my little town
My little town, my town, this is my town

So the city wasn't what you thought it'd be
Every night you woke up
In lost and found, you see
I saw you every night
And everybody is always in a hurry
Yeah they run, run, run, run
Oh man, that's just not me
I know you disagree
But I'll stay here in

My town, my little town
My little town, my town, this is my town
This is my town, my little town
My little town, my town, this is my town

But the city is always warm and pleasing
No stuck up folks, brand new diseases
Everywhere around
Get my kicks more than a lot
The more I get, the more I lose my appetite
And that's not right
I'll stay in

My town, my little town
My little town, my town, this is my town
This is my town, my little town
My little town, my town, this is my town

We got a supermarket and a church
For anyone who's got the urge
There's a nightclub and a school out there
Faith, a devil and a god
But more important, there's a bar
We've got neighbours with new cars
Not that us folks would drive real far




 Call up your loving friends
And spit 'em in the face
Call up a family member
And you do the same
You stop pretending
You believe that it's all true
'Cause after hanging up

You always feel ashamed
You and I we don't tell each other lies
We don't dress up in disguise
We don't hold back on the whys
'Cause you and I we don't tell each other lies
We don't dress up in disguise
We don't hold back on the whys

Guess we're two of a kind
On our own
I won't walk out, I won't leave you
All on your own
I won't leave you be
No you'll never walk alone

I sing about doing without
But I don’t know how
I'm tangled up inside your net
I can't get out
Coughed up my life
I changed it all by loving you
Don't ask me why, don't ask me how
Don't get me mushy now

Because you and I we don't tell each other lies
We don't dress up in disguise
We don't hold back on the whys
'Cause you and I we don't tell each other lies
We don't dress up in disguise
We don't hold back on the whys

Guess we're two of a kind
On our own
I won't walk out, I won't leave you
All on your own
I won't leave you be
Don't you know
You're never alone
Babe I know that we're two of a kind
All on our own
So I won't leave you be
No you'll never walk alone




 [Verse 1]
She walks in and says 'come on, let's have it'
She brings out the worst you can be
That's a good day for a bad habit
Don't you dare to disagree

She passed he thinks he's something groovin'
Straight down from church you wanna bet
She'll play him like some kinda movie
And smokes the last of his sigarettes

[Chorus]
She's got no mercy for the soldiers
No mercy for the king
No mercy for the soldiers
No mercy for the king
No mercy for the soldiers
And no mercy for no king
No mercy for no king

[Verse 2]
She picks his heart like it's a pocket
She wears her hair like it's a crown
She sees straight through all his cool poses
She'll hold the leash, good dog, sit down

[Chorus]
She's got no mercy for the soldiers
No mercy for the king
No mercy for the soldiers
No mercy for the king
No mercy for the soldiers
No mercy for the king
No mercy for the king

[Bridge]
Oohh, there won't be any mercy
Not unless you got a diamond ring
Oohh, no, there won't be no 'excuse me'
No mercy for the king of everything

[Chorus]
No mercy for the soldiers
No mercy for the king
No mercy for the soldiers
No mercy for the king
No mercy for no soldiers
No mercy for no king
No mercy, oohh, no mercy

No mercy for the soldiers
No mercy for the soldiers
No mercy for the soldiers
No mercy for no king
No mercy for no king




 Ran into water
Right up to the neck
To keep the head up
Drank it all down, swallowed it back
Don't believe in fighting
Or love made out of free will
There's a higher law up there somewhere
That laughs at every kill

There's no story to tell, my nose still bleeds
Nobody here can give me better help
There's no story to tell
No story to tell, see my nose still bleeds
Nobody here can give me better help
Than you do, my dear

The hairs on my arm are rising
The truth waiting for the kill
The sensation of you being around
Did more than memories ever will
And tired of the longing
So tired of the night
I'm so tired of the listening
To all the well, well-meant advice

No story to tell
Well my nose still bleeds
Nobody here can give me better help
No story to tell
No, there's no story to tell
See my heart still bleeds
Nobody here can give me better help
Than you do, my dear

I'll be the old man in the corner
To help you out of bed
To feed you and to listen to the silence instead
I'll be that wanted glass of water
When you're thirsty once again
The only one still here that really gives a damn

When there's no story to tell
When my nose still bleeds
Nobody here can give me better help
No story to tell
There's no story to tell
And my heart still bleeds
Nobody here can give a bigger damn
Than I do, my dear




 I’ll walk the line
You can shove everything that you have
You’ll throw it right back at me
Saying you couldn’t care less
You ask me where the window’s at
I tell you follow the smokers
If that’s impolite
You sure don’t belong to the jokers

There’s nothing between us
Except the air that we breathe
You build on the bullshit
You’ve got stuck up your sleeve
There’s nothing between us
Except the air that we breathe
You build on the bullshit
You’ve got stuck up your sleeve

I’ve done all my best
I’ve tried to make it worthwhile
So now the more you yell, spit and curse
The more that I smile First you dig up the dagger
Then you ram it all the way
Through my heart, and set fire
To the walls and you tear them apart
Then you sit, look and listen
While your wolves come and start

There’s nothing between us
Except the air that we breathe
You build on the bullshit
You‘ve got stuck up your sleeve
There’s nothing between us
Except the air that we breathe
You build on the bullshit
You got stuck up your sleeve

Brought back the joke
While you just blew smoke all the time
You shot at the sun and you missed it
I can still hear you whine

There’s nothing between us
Except the air that we breathe
You build on the bullshit
You‘ve got stuck up your sleeve
There’s nothing between us
Except the air that we breathe
You build on the bullshit
You still love to believe




 [Verse 1]
Er is verrekte veel te zeggen
En te liegen nog veel meer
Heel veel bagger bloot te leggen
Al doet het graven nog zo'n zeer
Ik ben een eikel maar ik leer

[Chorus]
Een oceaan om in te vluchten
Nooit jaloers te hoeven zijn
Liefde om je hart te luchten
Een oceaan
Hoe lekker zou het zijn

[Verse 2]
Was er iets waar ik om wenste
Voordat de put droog kwam te staan
Dan was het lang zullen ze leven
Familie waar ik veel van hou
En voor wie ik sterven zou

[Bridge]
Een oceaan om in te schuilen
Nooit alleen meer hoeven zijn
Ik heb gesmeekt niet meer te huilen
Alsjeblieft
Het leven jaagt geen angst meer aan
Ik heb al zo ver moeten kruipen
Het laatste stuk zal ook wel gaan
Tot ik ga staan

[Chorus]
Een oceaan om in te vluchten
Nooit jaloers te hoeven zijn
Liefde om je hart te luchten
Een oceaan
Alleen van mij

[Outro]
Een oceaan om te verzuipen
Een dag of wat een held te zijn
Laat die ander nu maar kruipen
Een oceaan
Vol tranen is van mij
Alleen van mij




 [Verse 1]
There's a lot of stuff to tell you
To lie about, there's even more
A lot of dirt around to dig in
Burning way down to the core
To be better than before

[Chorus]
An ocean blue, the pain away
Guess it's true, what they say
Change your mood, everyday
Ocean blue
To take the pain away
(Oh please take the pain away)

[Verse 2]
If there's anything I'd wish for
Before the wishing well dries out
It's that I won't outlive my children
Though when all is said out loud
Let they be fine without

[Bridge]
If there's an ocean to escape in
Where you'd never be alone
Well I've been begging to stop crying
Pretty please
'Cause I'm so tired of being scared
And I've been crawling for too long
I'll get up out of the dirt
And I'll be strong

[Chorus]
If there's an ocean to escape in
Drift away from jealousy
Love to dream and to awake in
An ocean blue for you and me
An ocean blue, the pain away
I guess it's true, what they say
Change your mood, everyday
Ocean blue
Please take the pain away
The pain away




 I walk passed the phone, I like to be alone
All on my own, inside my paper home

I wish I was good, I wish I was beautiful to you
And that you understood
That I'd fight a war for you, if I should

You sit by the fire, at least I imagine you do
L. Cohen sings Avalanche. I'm in a book, so are you
I wish you were here to run, laugh and cry with me
Suddenly appear to love, live and die with me

In dreams I save you from harm
In dreams you always worship me
Like I've always worshipped you
In dreams we're together, it's you and me I see

I can always pretend when I don't want to be alone
That you're back again, safe in our paper home

Things I've done wrong, countless in name and number
But pride feels no pain
Now I run off to hide my shame




 I walk passed the phone
And I like to be alone
All on my own
Inside my paper home

Yeah well
I wish I was good
And I wish I was beautiful to you
And that you understood
That I'd fight a war for you
If I should
If I should

You sit by the fire
At least I imagine you do
L. Cohen sings Avalanche
I'm in a book, so are you
I wish you were here
To run, laugh and cry with me
Suddenly appear
To love, live and die with me

In dreams I save you from harm
In dreams you always worship me
Like I've always worshipped you
In dreams we're together
It's you and me, I see
Yeah that I see

I can always pretend
When I don't want to be alone
That you're back again
Safe in our paper home

Things I've done wrong
Countless in name and number
But pride feels no pain
Now I run off to hide my shame

In dreams I save you from harm
Yes in dreams you always worship me
Like I've always worshipped you
O in dreams we're together
It's you and me
That I see

Too bad it's just a dream
Maybe…never mind




 First we drink our coffee now
And talk about nothing in particular
Why don't we just sit back and enjoy the silence for a while

Truth no lies, tears and smiles are locked in our eyes
As we sit here and drink a beer and do nothing in particular
Nothing in particular
But I enjoy myself; I got my friends around me

Close your eyes and drift away
You don't have to stay awake to talk to me when you know nothing to say
Why can't we just sit back and feel the love between us now

Truth no lies, tears and smiles are locked in our eyes
As we sit here and drink a beer and do nothing in particular
Nothing in particular
But I enjoy myself; I got my friends around me




 Rapid eye movement bores the shit right out of me
But that don't mean that they suck objectively
They're fine in some eyes
In mine, they're better without sound
Some like the moon half way, others like it round

Chorus:
Because it's a free world we're living in
So what I say is my opinion, not necessarily yours

Some say you're crazy, others tell you you're a fool
Some say you're lazy and you have to learn the rules
Grow up just like us and we swear you will be cool, well
Shit I'm a crazy fool cool without your rules

Because it's a free world we're living in
So what I say is my opinion, not necessarily yours

Falling was against the rules everything is breaking
Don't you bend or break the rules everyone is mistaken once
We're mistaken once

It's a free world we're living in
But what you say is your opinion, not necessarily mine
It's a free world we're living in
So what I say is my opinion, not necessarily yours




 I am sorry that you missed me, guess I'm on my way
Pretty fed up right here, time for me to leave
Pretty sure I cannot stay

You lost your beliefs and a piece of me
I was tied down in your safetynet, how much safer can you get
You dropped me in the deep and in the deep I cannot breathe

So I reached out and you promised you would help
You walked out, ok I'll back myself
I screamed out, I trusted on your help
You backed out, ok, I'll back myself

I was down, I was under and I couldn't break my fall
You crossed your heart, hoped to die, you said to me
That I could fly if I wanted to, I couldn't fall
Well you lied

Chorus

I don't see it anymore, she said don't worry buddy
'cause they're the same like before

You gotta remember, so you won't forget
'Cause if memories save me, then I live I bet
You just got to remember, you'll always forget
So if memories leave ,then I guess it means that I'm dead

Chorus




 Someone should know the way
But they just failed to tell me
And don’t be late they say
Don’t be late
Someone should know your name
Grabs your new guitar
Throws it on the fire It burns ok

Nobody gets the best of me
Before they see the worst I'd better leave
Nobody gets the best of me
Before they see my worst I never

Run out
Run out
Run out
I run out
Run out

Better be one’s own
But you can’t live on air alone
Beggars they don’t choose and yes you do
Maybe I know the way
Maybe I know the why, he says
Better ask no questions
Hear no lies

Nobody gets the best of me
Before they see the worst I'd better leave
Nobody gets the best of me
Before they see the worst I never

Run out
Run out
Run out
I run out
Run out




 [Verse 1]
How I wish for a flame that never dies
Like a candle and it’s flame bring back the light
You put on your shoes of lightning
You put on your shoes and run
You’ll be the lightning bolt
So put them on
Put on your shoes of fire
You put on your shoes that burn
If you get burned, my love
Well that’s exactly how you learn

[Chorus]
Bring on the day to come
And you wear it like a brand new one
You put on your shoes of lightning
Let them run
You let them run

[Verse 2]
There’s always an ugly duckling
There’s always an ugly one
Give her a chance to grow
Into a pretty, pretty one
There’s always a mean machine
There’s always a beauty queen
Always so many fools
That don’t care about the other ones

[Chorus]
Bring on the day to come
And you wear it like a brand new one
Put on the shoes of lightning
Let them run
You let them run
Bring on the day to come
And wear it like a brand new one
Put on your shoes of lightning
Put them on
Let them run

[Bridge]
Zap away on your tv
Things that you don’t wanna see
Get your head out of your ass
Ignorance is such bliss
Don’t you stand there like the rest
Without a heart you’ll finish last
Without a heart you’ll finish last

[Chorus]
Bring on the day to come
And wear it like a brand new one
You put on the shoes of lightning
Put them on
You put them on
Bring on the day to come
And you wear it like a brand new one
Put on the shoes of lightning
Let them run
You let them run
Bring on the day to come
And wear it like it’s a brand new one
Put on your shoes of lightning
Let them run

[Outro]
I wish for a flame that never dies
Like a candle and it’s flame bring back the light




 Shooting star, here you are, the first time you fly by
I made a wish; a simple kiss was enough to make me look at you, so this is you
So surprised how time flies. Big ass car, dressed you are
Smooth and silky, you look nice

Shooting star, here you are, the second time you fly by
Back again star-eye ten
Without reasons why you wind me up before I drop
Something's in my eye now
In the name of this song and by all that I have done wrong

How are you what's going on?
Can I get you anything to drink?
Because time flies when you're having fun
I guess I haven't got that much to say

Do you recall that week in fall?
Your hands stuck in your tight jeans
Drunk as hell, you just fell facedown into dog smell
How do you just think I do, the rope you had around me
Now you're back, you say to stay but who's to blame you're not the same in many ways

How are you what's going on?
Can I get you anything to drink?
Time flies when you're having fun
I guess I haven't got that much to say

Stay away, because we don't have a deal
Stay away. 'cause when you come you'll go and leave me numb to stay
So this is what we have come to

Shooting star, here you are, the third time you fly by
I made a wish to forget your kiss and your smile...
Your smile...
It is your smile...
It's your smile...

So tell me
How are you what's going on
I guess I haven't got this much to say
How are you what's going on
I guess I haven't got this much to say




 All the side effects were never mentioned to me
I am innocent of uncontrolled abuse
No one ever told me cigarettes could kill me
Now I'm used to them
I never saw the writings and the warnings
On the packages and posters of my role-up smokes
Tell me that's a hoax
Got the freakin' idea I could be like James Dean
15 years old with my foot against the wall
Getting smoke into my eyes not that I'd show you
Being cool and man I never saw
The writings and the warnings
On the packages and posters of my roll-up smokes
Tell me that's a hoax

The pores of plague that tease the cow
The cross-eyed steak I'm eating now
Can overload and in time explode

[Chorus]
Pretty done for, heaven knows, the city's like a snake
All wrapped up and tangled in. Reality's a fake
The flashy coloured neon signs are screaming 'Ain't it great!
Come dance with us, take your chance with us'

We're left for dead. Without beliefs we're dead
We're scared, but won't admit to all of this, I bet
So we cease to care instead

Now I'm stuck between the alcohol and wisdom
Now I'm stuck between a smoke and city air
Almost used to all these crappy things we feed on
Almost belly round and unaware

[Chorus]

All the side effects were never mentioned to me, So I am innocent




 All the side effects
Were never mentioned to me
I am innocent of uncontrolled abuse
No one ever told me cigarettes could kill me
Now I'm used to them

I never saw the writings and the warnings
On the packages and posters
Of my role-up smokes
Tell me that's a hoax

The writings and the warnings
On the packages and posters
Of my role-up smokes
Tell me that's a hoax

Got the freakin' idea
I could be like James Dean
15 years old with my foot against the wall
Getting smoke into my eyes
Not that I'd show you
Being cool and man

I never saw the writings and the warnings
On the packages and posters
Of my role-up smokes
Tell me that's a hoax

The pores of plague that tease the cow
The cross-eyed steak I'm eating now
Can overload and in time explode

Pretty done for, heaven knows
The city's like a snake
All wrapped up and tangled in
Reality's a fake
The flashy coloured neon signs
Are screaming 'Ain't it great!
Come dance with us, take your chance with us

We're left for dead
Without beliefs we're dead
We're scared, but won't admit, to all of this, I bet
We're scared, but won't admit, to all of this I bet
So we cease to care instead

Now I'm stuck between the alcohol and wisdom
Now I'm stuck between a smoke and city air
Almost used
To all the crappy things we feed on
Almost belly round and unaware

Pretty done for, heaven knows
The city's like a snake
All wrapped up and tangled in
Reality's a fake
The flashy coloured neon signs
Are screaming 'Ain't it great!
Come dance with us, take your chance with us

We're left for dead
Without beliefs we're dead
We're scared, but won't admit, to all of this, I bet
We're scared, but won't admit, to all of this I bet

We're left for dead (side effects)
Without beliefs we're dead (side effects)
We're scared, but won't admit, to all of this, I bet
We're scared, but won't admit, to all of this I bet
So we cease to care instead

All the side effects
Were never mentioned to me
So I am innocent




 So much difference now, the feeling's letting down
I have a notion where I am although I'm scared some how
So not a dropping in, more a dropping out
It fell so loud that I found out I always done without
I dreamt that nothing's wrong, everything just smiled
In this worthwhile dream of mine a beauty place combined
I saw eagles fly, a grey sky open up
A star explode as others float between the mountaintops
She said: 'That's another kind of magic, I swear, things go smoothly'

I guess it's up to me
Somewhere hid away, well there is a cure but I ain't sure whether it's mine to pay
'cause all the time I tried to give my dreams a life
Every time that I woke up I simply closed my eyes

She said: 'That's another kind of magic
I swear, things go smoothly'
She said: 'Man I promise you it gets better, we're there...'

Futile dreams and reasons floating in the air
I stay silent. And I gave up the try to walk on water. For you
For you, so smooth...

I feel weary now, shaky in the gut
And what if I woke up and saw that dreams is all I got
I guess I'd laugh at life, sneaky in the hand
Because it's a bitch to find out things ain't going as you planned

But she said: 'That's another kind of magic
I swear, things go smoothly
She said: 'Man I promise its gets better, we're there

She said: 'Are you willing to look the other way
She said: 'Are you willing to take chances'
I said: 'It's best if you just walk away'
She said: 'Life is short and meaningless, unless you make the best of it'




 Spit your heart out
Just be careful what you say to me
In the long run
It blows up in your face you see

They're all so friendly
They don't know the names of you and me
Well let them talk out loud, real loud
If they wanna talk so loudly

But I'm not going to keep those secrets away from you
I'm not going to keep those secrets away from you
I want to walk the tide go pass me down

Spit your heart out
Just be careful what you say
'Cause in the long run
It will blow up eventually

They're so friendly
They will never even know your name
Have to watch it serious
And tell me why do they control the game

I'm not going to keep those secrets away from you
I'm not going to keep those secrets away from you
Tomorrow takes to long

Don't wanna walk the path that goes through the day
Don't fool us much to long
It's hard to keep a secret nowadays
So tired every secret sails away

Just be careful what you say
Spit your heart out
Just be careful what you say

I'm not going to keep those secrets away from you
I'm not going to keep those secrets away from you




 Start a war with all your friends
Kick 'em down the street
That's the way to treat your friends
That's a friend indeed
Start a war to spread your name
Start a war to gain fame
Start a war by wanting more
More than just one war

I might be wrong, I might be insane
I might be fooling myself
I can win I might be biting my nails
While I'm biting the dust
But I won't dance for daddy
Don't dance for daddy

Start a war by playing games
Start a war by leaving
Start a war by shifting the blame
Start a war just being
I might be wrong, I might be insane
I might be fooling myself I can win
I might be biting my nails While
I'm biting the dust
But I don't dance for....

Hell no, you'll end up losing each other
While we're living on dead end street
Hell no, you'll end up shooting your brother
While we live on dead end street
Hell no, stick up for each other
Hell no, we're so alike the other
Hell no, cause you're my brother, brother
We all live on dead end street

Start a war by being born
Start a war by praying
Start a war because you’re bored
Start a war by staying
Start a war as a cover machine
Start a war 'cause of visions or dreams
Start a war with the gun of your pa pa pa
Blow the class to smithereens

Hell no, you'll end up losing each other
While we're living on dead end street
Hell no, you'll end up shooting your brother
While we live on dead end street
Hell no, stick up for each other
Hell no, we're so alike the other
Hell no, cause you're my brother, brother
While we live on dead end street

Dead end street
Dead end street
Dead end street




 [Verse 1]
He crossed the street he knew so well
Got lost there every day
Cursed his work, cried in shame
And was really glad it rained

[Chorus]
Let's trade our tears for diamonds
Trade our tears for diamonds

[Verse 2]
Stepping in the day was long
Much longer than the time
No one around here gave a damn
Not even just a dime

[Chorus]
So let's trade our tears for diamonds
Let's trade our tears for diamonds

[Post-Chorus]
On and on it goes and goes
On and on
Sorry, he never seems to cut it

[Verse 3]
He's poor as fuck and he still deserves
A statue so they say
He took good care of wife and kids
But they left him anyway

[Chorus]
Let's trade his tears for diamonds
Let's trade his tears for diamonds

[Post-Chorus]
On and on it goes and goes
On and on
Sorry, he never seems to cut it
To cut it

[Verse 4]
We change the things we used to love
Until they make us hate
We can dress up on the outside
But inside there's just no way

[Chorus]
Let's trade our tears for diamonds
Let's trade our tears for diamonds

[Post-Chorus]
On and on it goes and goes
On and on
Sorry, he never seems to cut it




 I'm waiting here for you to call
But still don't here the ring at all
And you promised me the use of the telephone

And now my seat is getting warm
And my drawing go to be a bore
And I'm feeling all alone

The dog is lazy, oh so sweet
She lies there very peacefully
And she looks at me with eyes that say 'Don't panic man'
She'll call…

Well it's Saturday and it rains outside
And Ben Folds helped me through the night
And doggie is waiting by the door for me

You didn't call me yesterday
Maybe you've got the guts today
Not that you are that important to me

The dog is lazy, oh so sweet
She lies there very peacefully
And she looks at me with eyes that say 'Don't panic man'
She'll call…

You know, she will

I'm going out, have work to do
So I don't have don't have to think about
You obviously are different than I thought

You didn't call me yesterday
You didn't call today
Well, that's okay, I wouldn't have a clue, just what to say

And as I open up the door, to walk the dog, just slight before
The phone is ringing, my heart is pounding
She called

To say I shouldn't worry
I shouldn't worry




 Oooh oooh ooh
Oooh oooh ooh

The Less we have
The more we long
For things we're thrown away
I wish I had a nickle for
My well made mistakes
Meanwhile the little one falls
And the little one calls
Yeah the little one lies in need
Meanwhile the bigger ones pull
And the bigger ones push
The bigger ones feed on greed

Oooh oooh ooh

Some would say
You're better off alone
Without a heart
Some can play that silly game
Called 'ego' from start
Meanwhile the little one falls
And the little one calls
But the bigger ones throw them aside
Meanwhile the little ones bleed
And the little ones see
There's no one on their side

Oooh oooh ooh
Oooh oooh ooh

Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh ooh
Oooh oooh ooh

The less we have
The more we long
For things we've thrown away
I wish I had a nickel for
My well made mistakes
I wish I had a nickel for
My well made mistakes

Oooh oooh ooh
My well made mistakes

Oooh oooh ooh
My well made mistakes




 [Verse 1]
Fell out of the family tree
Lost my face, saw people gathering around
I broke much more than they could see
They stole my heart straight out of me
No more ways to apologize
And there's nothing upon my sleeve
I tainted the windows too dark, I guess
Too dark for them to see

[Chorus]
I'm the man who lost his pride
I got nothing left to hide
I'm the man who lost his pride
I'm the man who lost his pride
I got nothing left to hide
I'm the man who lost his pride (lost his pride)

[Verse 2]
Caught up in between history
And the fire that burns in the future
Look at the sky light, up at night
And why the hell am I afraid to lose him?
Don't give up, just give a damn again
It's about time you started making sense
Step out of that hell that you know so well
And give the time you've got left a chance
Go on, give the time you've got left a chance

[Chorus]
Cause you're the man who lost his pride
And with nothing left to hide
The man who's dreams have died
No more, you've thrown your life aside
Cause if the birds can fly that high
Then so can you, so can you and so can I
You're the man who lost his pride
With nothing left to hide
The man who's dreams have died

[Outro]
If they can do it then why the hell can't we?




 There's a lot of things I didn't do
There's a lot of things I did
There's a million ways to follow through
Only a couple are good I bet
Although I know we’ll all be left alone
I can hang my head in shame
But hell, there’s a hundred thousand ways

To hide the pain
I don't mean to walk away
Not while others are still standing
I don't want to take your shame
When it's helping you remember
I won't take away your name
Go on and live your life in anger
No, I don't want to die today
Nor will I live my life in pain

Don't mean to be rude or anything
I don't mean to be rude to anyone
Don't mean to be rude or anything
I'm just breaking my head
Thinking of you Thinking of you

Thinking of you
I don't want to brag away
Using words as sweet as honey
Don't believe when people say
A rich man’s joke is always funny
Do you still fight for the things you want
Or have you given up your anger
You're still a dreamer day by day

I guess you shot down your ideals
I don't mean to be rude or anything
I don't mean to be rude to anyone
I don't mean to be rude or anything
I'm just breaking my head

Thinking of you
Thinking of you
Thinking of you
Thinking of you
Thinking of you

I don’t mean to be rude or anything
I don't mean to be rude to anyone
I don't mean to be rude or anything
I'm just breaking my head

Thinking of you
Thinking of you
Thinking of you
Thinking of you
Thinking of you
Thinking of you
Thinking of you
Thinking of you
Thinking of you




 Tic toc, 1 listen to the clock
I wonder if she's gonna come over
Or if she's gonna stay away, again today
Tic toe, why don't the bummer stop
She's late, just look at the clock I'm f ***ed
Already missing her a lot

This is all she seems to do
This is all f need to know
0 Eleanore why don't you show
Tic toc, I'm running out of luck
I know Eleanore is gone now
She's gonna lend someone a f.f.f.f.f

They say, it's all a big mistake
And that it's more than I should take
0 yet I love her so, still she don't seem to behave though

This is all she seems to do
This is all I need to know
0 Eleanore why don't you show

I wish you could star in all of my shows
A different soap everyday to suit you
Never gonna go anywhere you know Eleanore
O no, I'm never gonna go anywhere you know Eleanore
'cause I'm all yours, love

Tic toc, I'm thinking about a lot
Why does beauty always stop and
Makes you wish you had a brick for a heart

So true, I got a lot to do
Can always read a book or even
Watch 'have I got news for you'

This is all I seem to do
It ain't much f need to know
0 Eleanore I can't let go

Chorus (2x)




 [Verse 1]
Well Tommy was always different
He wouldn't hang around in bars, didn't care for fancy cars
Some people tried to hurt him
Yeah let's give the boy another scar or rip that cotton skirt he loves
Yeah Tommy was always different
If you called the boy a fool, he'd just throw a smile at you
So people sit and listen
Let me tell a tale to you about brave young Tommy Cool

[Chorus]
Always Tommy
Always pick on Tommy Cool
Always Tommy
Always pick on Tommy Cool
Always Tommy Cool

[Verse 2]
So Tommy grew in different
He didn't hang that loose with other peoples lack off clues
But he paid for that indifference
Cause there was nothing taught at school about boys like Tommy Cool

[Chorus]
Always Tommy
Always pick on Tommy Cool
Always Tommy
Always pick on Tommy Cool
Always Tommy Cool

[Verse 3]
And one day there's no Tommy
They hadn't seen the boy in days
Who cares, is what they say
His car stood abandoned
Close to where they found his skirt, and later Tommy in the dirt

[Chorus]
Always Tommy
Always pick on Tommy Cool
Always Tommy
Always pick on Tommy Cool
Always Tommy
Always pick on Tommy Cool
Always Tommy Cool

[Verse 4]
May he hunt you in your sleep
They all drift be full of fire
They hold your soul to keep with a devilish desire
You be aware of all the angels
Cause they are singing in the choir
Oh beware off al the angels with their devilish desires
Devilish desires
Devilish desires
Devilish desires
Devilish desires

Always on Tommy cool
Tommy




 One party to call. Two people. one falls
No mermory at all. Just a waiting list
Some yelling, some tall
Some quiet, some small
They nibble on, well, anyone. No can do for you doll

Took a hit, a good hit. Like a car into the wall
What a hit, a real hit, when I thought I'd seen it all
Took a hit, a good hit. Let the dealer make the call
Oh man I thought I'd seen it all

You throw out the recipe, forget about you and me
You throw out the recipe. It's not about you or me
Throw out the recipe, forget about you and me
You throw out the recipe, because the good life, the good love, the good bits are for free

Some ladies out there, nobody that seems to care
No beauty queens, out there. Just a waiting list
Thick stare straight through the room, we all give away the goods too soon
And we're waiting for something to say, instead of listening

Took a hit, a good hit, like a car into the wall
Oh man I thought I'd seen it all

You throw out the recipe, forget about you and me
You throw out the recipe. It's not about you or me
Throw out the recipe, forget about you and me
You throw out the recipe, because the good life, the good love, the good bits are for free

Oh, that's what all good love should be

Took a hit, a good hit, like a car into the wall
Oh man I thought I'd seen it all

You throw out the recipe, forget about you or me
You throw out the recipe. It's not about you or me
Throw out the recipe, forget about you and me
You throw out the recipe, because the good love, the good life, the good bits are..

The recipe, forget about you and me
Throw out the recipe. It's not about you or me
Throw out the recipe, forget about you and me
You throw out the recipe, because the good love, the good life, the good bits are for free




 You cover your eyes, if you can't stand the side
Walk away
You cover your ears, so you don't have to hear
Walk away
You cover your nightmares, you put them away
'cause if nobody knows then they might go away
Walk away, walk away, walk away
Without me

You cover your lies with stories and smiles
Walk away
You're scared what to find so you just run and hide
You run away

If you play with a gun then you will shoot someone
When you sit in the fire it's your ass getting warm
Walk away, walk away, walk away
Without me, without me, without me, without me

Why do yell, you can whisper as well
Walk away
These teardrops of rain, they're masking your shame
You walk away
In this midsummer storm you see a midsummer fight
Put your head in the sand if you can't make it right
Walk away, walk away, walk away
Without me




 Stay alone love, mommy's going away tonight
Leave the light in the hallway on when you are frightened
And try not to be sad. There's water by the bed

Say goodnight love, 'cause daddy's going away tonight Don't you worry, I promise I'll be home on time You'll be fine love. Doggy's there so you won't be alone You're a big girl. We'll be back before you know
And please try not to scream, 'cause it's not all bad you see

I'm begging you, please don't go
I'm scared alone mom you should know
I'm scared of dreaming on my own
I'm begging you mom please don't turn the lights down low

See you soon love. We'll be home around 11.00
When you're hungry, there's some dinner in the oven
And when you're sad or alone, the number's by the phone
And please try not to scream. When it's only a, it's only a bad dream

Chorus




 Daybreak, another new day shines, the school dance is coming in
She's giving dad the 'Please can I, Charlie is taking me'
Charlie that worthless son of a gun. You better ask your mom'
She said: '0 dad give me a break, a miracle is what it takes
If you say yes, she can't say no'. And dad said; 'Allright, go
But there's a curfew and behave, don't spend all your money
0 and Wendy Be home 11.30
Wendy listen to your daddy'

11.30, home she is. 'Mom, dad, I'm going to bed'
Kiss kiss and goes upstairs, she s sneaking out the window
Tearing up her rental dress
Her friends are waiting down the street
'Hey Charlie, Tom and Emma, here is Wendy, brought a bit of brandy'
Wendy listen to your daddy

Safe sex and liquor in the punch
Hangs out with Charlie and the bunch
Wendy in the backseat of a chevy

Supposedly the night is gone, Wendy had lots of fun
But daddy screams: 'What have you done
You're grounded 'till your twenty-one'

Wendy, should have listened to your daddy

Wendy




 Walk away, don't make me cry
Please don't try to save the lie
The love I feel is much too real
The love I feel is much too real

Damaging the trust I had
Pace beaten out of my head
The pain I feel is much too real
The pain I feel is much too real

The words you said to me that day
I'm pretty far from being okay

Better now, and I drink a lot
To banish you out of my heart
My emptiness is growing still
I still feel pain against my will




 I don't mind that you're pulling my hair again
And I don't mind that you're wearing my shoes again
Pencilstripe joke still stuck upon my chin
But I don't ever try to argue about those silly moods you're in
Because I know I never win
But all this s mine

I'd give you the world on a plate anytime
If you can carry the weight
But this stays mine, my world on a plate
All of this stays mine

I don't blame you for calling me names a bit
Go ahead, take all my money, I don't really give a shit
Because I never sit on it
But all this is mine

I'd give you the world on a plate anytime
If you can carry the weight
But this stays mine, my world on a plate
All of this stays mine

Oh what a feeling, what a joy
I guess I've finally found my treasure
Nothing anyone can measure though
You know my heart leaves me no choice
And to piss against the wind girl, That's another kind of matter
So that's why I let you know
That's why I can't let this go

I don't mind that you're pulling my hair again
And I don't mind that you're wearing my shoes again

I'd give you the world on a plate anytime
If you can carry the weight
But this stays mine, my world on a plate
All of this stays mine




 What would you do in a world without worries
Where would you go if you needed to hide
Would you be brave enough to say you're sorry
That he was the one that you broke out of line
You're pretty small in words I guess
I'm growing tired of all those bruises
Can take no more and you'll cut me for less
Well if you let her bleed I won't leave it at this

Kind of an ignoring storm situation.Harder than you ever tried
We're faking the real. We're on life simulation
Harder than you ever tried

You're walking away before you lose
You're walking away before you get bruised
You're walking away, you've got some to lose
And turn up with four of your friends
You motherfucker. I'm so fed up with your hate
I'm so fed up with your beat
I'm so fed up with your threats
So now it's time you get fed up with me

Chorus

So I'll say goodnight to the one set aside
Tell me who's wrong And in time please tell me who's right
If you got the guts that is I sing you a song and you sing along
While somebody screams, hoping it's just a bad dream

So what would you do in a world without worries
Where would you go if you needed to hide
You're pretty small in words I see
Would you stick up for me
Or walk away before you lose it, because it's the heart of your life
Or walk away before you bruise it
It's harder than you've ever tried. Harder than you've ever tried




 Cut your fingers on the wreck
It ain't dead yet but it's dying
First it fed your intellect
Then it crushed you like an insect
It's unable to forget
So why bother even trying
Fake a smiley smile instead
You should be trying brother
You gotta be trying brother, yeah

"Get the fuck out of my way"
She was crying and she screamed
"You go do what it is you do
Just give me some room please"
Don't tell me how the story ends
Cause I'm messed up and convinced
That I found out nobody's cool
Except maybe smiling you

Cause when you're wearing a smile
It should make it worth while
There's plenty of time

He Ho - I wanna feel a lot better
He Ho - I wanna feel a lot better

Cut your fingers on the wreck
Cause you're a sentimental fool
I know you cannot have things back
No exceptions to the rule
I know you won't cut me some slack
Cause you got to keep your cool
You hold your head up with your hands
You'll be smiling like a fool

Cause when you're wearing a smile
You make it worth while
There's plenty of time to be old later
Wearing a smile should make it worth while
Plenty of time

He Ho - I wanna feel a lot better
Sunday's always better than today
I wanna feel a lot better

I walked and let the city bleed
'cause the wreck was haunting me
I went for good old friends advice
Cause I couldn't clearly see
And then I recognised the roads
Everything fell in it's place
Cause all I did was hang on to a world in which no-one was

Wearing a smile should make it worth while
There's plenty of time to be old later
Wearing a smile should make it worth while
Plenty of time

He Ho - So I'll feel a lot better
He Ho - I'm gonna fee a lot better

Dirty money
Sunday's moving
I still feel a lot better
Dirty money
Sunday's moving
I'm gonna feel a lot better




 Princess young and wise you are
Getting ready to be a star
But you already are to me
Keep you safe, court the door for you
All protect you from the fools
And the crazy things you one day may do

All in good time
All in good time
All in good time

If it turns up you're just like me
Count to ten, baby, one, two, three
But if you're stronger than your on
Help the weak when they needed safe
Stay safe when the wind is weak
Without you I'm nothing, I'm no one

All in good time
All in good time
Yeah, All in good time

All in good time
All in good time
Yeah, All in good time
All in good time
All in good time
All in good time

Princess young and wise you are
Getting ready to be a star
You'll always be a star to me
