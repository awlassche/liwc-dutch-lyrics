8 years just all went down the drain
I'll make sure I make it up to you
Try not to make the same mistakes again
I keep my word and make it work for you

So what I'm trying to say is
Lay it down

There's no way to win this life ain't always fair
And once you learn how to play it
You still ain't there
Just hold your breath and watch the sun but don't get burned
But help the ones you love and try in your own way
To be free

Don't worry 'bout how it all went wrong
'Cause it won't change the past you see
And despite all the things I know
There's no place that I would rather be

Just hold on

What it all comes down to we will be just fine
But every now and then you'll find out there's no way
Out of this troubled state of mind I say
Sometimes you won't understand the way they play
But it won't break you

(I'm gonna make you believe)
I'm gonna make you see
You have to love
(I'm gonna make you believe)
The things that life is giving you my child
(I'm gonna make you believe)
I'm gonna make you baby make you make you baby
(I'm gonna make you believe)
And I'll be here to love you
There we go

There's no way to win this life ain't always fair
But ones you learn how to play it
You still ain't there
Just hold your breath and watch the sun but baby don't get burned
And help the ones you love and try in your own way
To be free

 Live at "A.A. tour"
You, you you make me live my
Happy heart
To my love
And now you're gone
Since I fell for you
Love, brings my misery pain
Cause I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you, yeah baby
Since your love
Since I fell for you




 Years flew by of the wicked life
Time is running out
I'm a falling star, in a big ass car
Born to stand out
Yeah I got old, but never got wise
So much to be done
It's a mirror, mirror on the wall
Said the downfall is gonna come
Now let's go

Come, and dance, and party
Cause we're not getting any younger
We're not at all getting fat
Come, and dance, and party
Cause we're not getting any younger
We're not at all getting fat, noo noo

Now you're finally grown, live a lie of your own
Learn how to give and take
Though your body doesn't move like it did before
Your reputation is at stake
Don't you be sad, don't be afraid now
Don't be afraid of what you become
No more confussion with the loves and illusion
When you end up all alone
Now sing along now

Come, and dance, and party
Cause we're not getting any younger
We're not at all getting fat
Come, and dance, and party
Cause we're not getting any younger
We're not at all getting fat, nooo

When it comes to dancing baby
We know how to twist and jive
Let me work and make me crazy
We're on our way to paradise
Tell me what you're waiting for
Get on the floor now, bag it up
Cause we don't really wanna know
The weight we'll in and how we all will go

Come, and dance, and party
Cause we're not getting any younger
We're not at all getting fat
Come, and dance, and party
Cause we're not getting any younger
We're not at all getting fat, nooo

Come and dance the night away




 Walking through September rains unknowing
Are you come around stead gets to growing
As you slowly fade you
You were standing tall but that's the past
As many other things, they do not last

(Pre-Chorus)
Although I had to step away, step away
I'm wondering, are you lonely?
Ever since you walked away, walked away
It's so clear

(Chorus)
'Cause when you're in the shower all alone
It's when you fall down
Not able to stand up again
At night, as you're turning down the sheets
That's when you feel your mind
When it's trying to go back in time
You don't even know how it all started
Still begging for my love, now we have parted

(Pre-Chorus)
Although I had to step away, step away
I'm wondering, are you lonely?
Ever since you walked away, walked away
It's so clear

(Chorus)
'Cause when you're in the shower all alone
It's when you fall down
Not able to stand up again
At night, as you're turning down the sheets
That's when you feel your mind
When it's trying to go back in time
Ever since you walked away, walked away
I'm wondering, are you lonely?




 Walking through September rains unknowing
How you come around, is that guilt still growing?

As you slowly fade away
You were standing tall, but that's the past
As many other things they do not last

Though I had to step away
I'm wondering are you lonely
Ever since you walked away
It's so clear

Cause when you're in a shower all alone
That's when you fall down
Not able to stand up again
At night as you turn down the sheets
That's when you feel your mind
When it's trying to go back in time

You don’t even know how it all started
Still begging for my love, now we have parted

Though I had to step away
I'm wondering are you lonely
Ever since you walked away
It's so clear

Cause when you're in a shower all alone
That's when you fall down
Not able to stand up again
At night as you're turning down the sheets
That's when you feel your mind
When it's trying to go back in time




 I know the drill
You got your ball and chain
Hold you down
The circle round the story stays the same
It won't be long
And then your heart is frozen
The time is coming
To break away
You got it all
What makes you hestitate
Dont just wait
For things to blow up in your pretty face
And if the way
You try not to let it slip away
And you may find yourself again
And I feel
People just dont know you
Like I do
When they making it
So hard to see
When there's something wrong
It goes on and on
I know the drill
You got your ball and chain
I found out the second
Round that somethings never change
Open my eyes
And let the days come over me
Maybe it will go away
And I feel
People just dont know you
Like I do
When you're making it
So hard to see
When there's something wrong
On and on and on
You'll see
Now everybody is here
To break your heart
So there is a price to pay
To be someone you're not




 I know the drill
You got your ball and chain
It holds you down, the circle round
This story stays the same
It won't be long
And then your heart is frozen
The time has come to break away
You've got it all
What makes you hesitate?
Don't just wait for things
To blow up in your pretty face
Lift the weight
Try not to let it slip away
And you may find yourself again
I feel people just don't know you like I do
Why you're making it so hard to see
When there's something wrong
It goes on and on
I know the drill
You've got your ball and chain
I found out the second round
That some things never change
Open my eyes
And let the days come over me
And maybe it will go away
I feel people just don't know you like I do
Why you're making it so hard to see
When there's something wrong
It goes on and on
You'll see not everybody's here
To break your heart
So there is a price to pay
To be someone you're not
I know the drill
You've got your ball and chain
I found out the second round
That some things never change
Open my eyes
And let the days come over me
And maybe it will go away




 I guess this time, I had more than enough
You allowed my mind, to think there's no true love
Baby you're out of line, waisting all my time
Now find your own, to brighten up your life
I got a dark cold feeling, that I've been here before
The obvious is hard to see
She turned around and smiled, in her high heel shoes
Standing right in front of me
And I said leave him alone
Find one of your own
Took me a long time, to find a man like mine
The dreamer with a right run
Now he ain't made for you, like the way I am
It's not for you to understand
And I said leave him alone
And find a man of your own
Don't you break up my heart
Yeah, leave him alone
I hate it, I hate it
I'll need a big black hole, for you to fall in
Baby, you ain't coming back
And if you try once more, you get to fit in the door
I'll be taking you to pitch black
You can't have my own, no
I'm out of control
So I am asking you nicely for the last time
To leave him alone
Find a man of your own
Don't you break up my heart
Girl, leave mine alone
Oohh, I guess this time, I had more than enough
'Cause you will allow my mind, to think there's not true love
Oehh baby, you're out of line, you're waisting all my time
Now find your own man, to brighten up your life, heeyy, oehh

 [Verse 1]
You'll always be my forever
My affection for you is deep
From the time I wake up to the time I sleep
This could be so much better
Until your heart belongs to me
Yeah, every day feels incomplete

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's hard for me to see
Just the good times and not the bad
I'm trying so hard to be happy
But I don't know how to stop feeling sad

[Chorus]
Footsteps on the dance floor
I can't take it anymore
I want all of you
Until we're lovers holding hands
Dance with my [?] broke
With tears in my eyes
Cause nothing that I do
Cause all I want is you to want me too

[Post-Chorus]
Be my, be my, be my, be my baby
Be my, be my, be my, be my baby

[Verse 2]
First time that I saw your face
Honey, that is when I knew
That all of my dreams had just come true
I didn't know what to do
And no matter how hard I tried
I just can't get you outta my mind

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I want you to need me
Like the air that you breathe in
Make my dream a reality
Somehow I never know where to begin

[Chorus]
Footsteps on the dance floor
I can't take it anymore
I want all of you
Until we're lovers holding hands
Dance with my [?] broke
With tears in my eyes
Cause nothing that I do
Cause all I want is you to want me too

[Post-Chorus]
Be my, be my, be my, be my baby
Be my, be my, be my, be my baby

[Bridge]
I can't take it anymore
I want all of you
Come on, baby
I need you
(Be my baby)
I want you to be my baby all the time
(Be my baby)
Yeah, it is you who is always on my mind
Someone like you is hard to find

[Outro]
Footsteps on the dance floor
I can't take it anymore
I want all of you
Until we're lovers holding hands
Dance with my [?] broke
With tears in my eyes
Cause nothing that I do
Cause all I want is you to want me too
Be my, be my, be my, be my baby
(I want you to want me)
Be my, be my, be my, be my baby
(Cause I need you, baby)
Be my, be my, be my, be my baby
Be my, be my, be my, be my baby
(Oh oh)
Be my, be my, be my, be my baby
(Be my, be my)




 Mourning through thoughts of you
My heavy heart
Can't find my way around
It's morning when it starts
You and I wanted love, somewhere down the line
(You and I) All of the things that we've been through
(Don't you know) Deep down you know that I love you
(That by know) If you don't know that by now then
I might have to leave
Baby, you're telling me that I'm no good, and I don't even care
You make it so hard for me, to love you back in any way I can
Many times I am failing you, cannot give what I want you
And if you ride my side, my heart is made of stone
Then I'm better of alone
Building a para-case, day by day
Leaving me paralyzed, selfish and afraid
I am not who I was, I got broken deep inside
(Make it feel) I make you feel left out alone
(All alone) You need a place you can call home
(Need a home) What if I'm finding out now
I can't do that anymore
Baby, you're telling me that I'm no good, and I don't even care
You make it so hard for me, to love you back, the only way I can
Many times I am failing you, cannot give what I want you
And if you ride my side, my heart is made of stone
Then I'm better of alone
(I'm trying so hard to be the one that you think I should stay)
But it doesn't work that way
(I'm trying so hard to be the one that you think I should stay)
But I am so afraid, heyy, so afraid, so afraid, baby, oeehh
Baby you're telling me that I'm no good and I don't even care
You make it so hard for me to love you back in any way I can

 Between these walls I used to live
Without receiving
So much that I had to give
Between these walls
There were a lot of things
That I've could have done differently
But it ain't about the way I live
It's the heart that counts
Comfort, feed, embrace, love and protect me
Ain't that what I'm here for
You said you'd be here for me
No matter what
How come it feels so cold
Every time you step into this room
Why does it feel so cold when you're mine?
In the spring of '75 that's when God made a mistake
He took me here to the wrong side
I guess you did the best you could
But never good enough
'Cause it's the heart that counts
Comfort, feed, embrace, love and protect me
Ain't that what I'm here for?
You said you would die for me, remember?
How come it feels so cold
Every time you step into this room
Why does it feel so cold?
I'm freezing
Stuck here with this broken heart
All I can do is hoping for a full recovery
Why did you have me in the first place?
Well, comfort, feed, embrace, love and protect me, yeah
Comfort, feed, embrace, baby, just respect me
How come it feels so cold every time?
Comfort, feed, embrace, love and respect me
Just respect me, just respect me
How come it feels so cold every time?
Baby, love me
Baby, love me
You love me, yeah
Oh love me, yeah




 It's good to see you after all this time
It's good to know that you are doing fine
But I can't help but notice in a bar on Friday night
There is something you should tell me
But your driver waits outside

[Chorus]
You're moving on, you're going to a bigger world
You're moving on, you're ready for the universe
It's meaningless to me
'cause you're not here to see
The bigger side of me

I swear I saw a tear roll down your face
Bet there's a lot of smoke in bars these days
All I notice is the light that shines upon you from aside
Getting jealous of the coffee in the cup you hold so tight

Chorus

You're moving on to God knows where
Send me a postcard when you're there
Will I remember?
What will I say
"the weather is nice today" ?

Chorus




 Isolated from the outside
Clouds have taken all the light
I have no control
It seems my thoughts wonder all of the time
When I try to live life without you

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride

If being myself is what I do wrong
Then I would rather not be right
Hopes turned into fear
And with my one wing I can't fly with sunrise
Embrace my dreams tight
And that's why

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride
Birds

To a place without fear with no moonlight
All I need are trees and flowers and some sunlight
Where memories are being made
And where the old one dies
Where love ain't lost

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride
Birds




 Isolated from the outside
Clouds have taken all the light
I have no control it seems my
Thoughts wander off
Of the time when I tried to
Live life without you
Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride
If being myself is what I do wrong
Then I would rather not be right
Hopes turn into fear and with my
One wing I can't fly
With sunrise embrace my
Dreams tight and that's why
Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride
Birds
To a place without fear, with no moonlight
All I need are trees and flowers and some sunlight
Where memories are being made and where the old one dies
Where love ain't lies
Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride
That's why birds don't fly




 Isolated from the outside
Clouds have taken all the light
I have no control it seems my
Thoughts wander off

Of the time when I tried to
Live life without you

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride

If being myself is what I do wrong
Then I would rather not be right
Hopes turn into fear and with my
One wing I can’t fly

With sunrise embrace my
Dreams tight and that’s why

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride
Birds

To a place without fear, with no moonlight
All I need are trees and flowers and some sunlight
Where memories are being made and where the old one dies
Where love ain’t lies

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride
That’s why birds don’t fly




 By now I've realized my head knocks against the stars
I've been to hell and back, after I wondered where we belong
Spreading all this dirty lie, have we found us rolling by
He sheds light to my stars, now what about judgement
Will there ever be an heaven where we both can stay?

Blue motel
I'm in some far-off
Blue motel
A distant place
Blue motel
And all I am taught
Blue motel
Is a friendly face, hey

It feels good to know, although one will never be
You're looking at the same stars on this lonely planet with me
Will there ever be a church where we both feel free?

Blue motel
I'm in some far-off
Blue motel
Oh, a distant place
Blue motel
And all I am taught
Blue motel
Hey, is just a friendly face

To bring in the light
But my heart somehow prays
For yet another night
In this...
In this...
Blue, blue, blue, blue

Blue motel
Blue motel
Blue motel
Blue motel
Blue motel
Blue motel




 Well you know i've got this problem '
Cause there is you
No matter how i try to tell you you just can't see
Oh no, i won't get through

You've got a body and a brain

Instead of pointing to another
Take a look at yourself
Why don't you just use that thing inside you head
And try to tell me why

You've got a body and a brain
You're free to speak, could you explain
The reason for your narrow mind
You're thinking medieval times
Your ignorance just gets you scared
Of everything and i don't know
Which way the wind is blowing
Hoping it will blow your fears away

I'm sure i'll never solve this problem
But i hope you will
I'll speak my mind and tell you
Time and time again
Though i won't get through

You've got a body and a brain
You're free to speak, could you explain
The reason for your narrow mind
You're thinking medieval times
Your ignorance just gets you scared
Of everything and i don't know
Which way the wind is blowing
Hoping it will blow your fears away

Blow your fears away
Time and time and time and time again
But i can't get through baby
Let me explain

You've got a body and a brain
You're free to speak, could you explain
The reason for your narrow mind
You're thinking medieval times
Your ignorance just gets you scared
Of everything and i don't know
Which way the wind is blowing
Hoping it will blow your fears away

 Baby why you're so sad
What's the thing you're running from
Caught in the red lights
As if money is the cure
Is this your only way to survive
Are you trying to get even with the past
What happened to the dreams you had
I think it's time for you to
Show them you are able
To leave without saying one word
I know it won't be easy, baby
But I will run with you
'Cause every night has a day
Every wish a prayer
Don't loose your faith
And I'll be holding your hand
'Cause it's never too late
There's someone who needs you
So break down that wall, baby
There's a new world out there waiting
Just tear down that wall, girl
Run away and don't look back
Break down that wall
Break down that wall
There's someone who needs you
Lady it's your turn now
Just walk the streets with your head up high
Oh baby doesn't that feel right
So put a big smile on your face
You walk on straight
Yeah tell the motherf*ckers they were wrong
Isn't this your sweetest revenge
Feels good, hey I told you so
'Cause every night has a day
Every wish has a prayer
Don't loose your faith
And I'll be holding your hand
'Cause it's never too late
There's someone who needs you
So break down that wall, baby

Show them you are able
To leave without saying one word

There's a new world out there waiting
Just tear down that wall, girl
Run away and don't look back
Break down that wall
Break down that wall
There's someone who needs you

Lady it's your turn now
Just walk the streets with your head up high
Oh baby doesn't that feel right
So put a big smile on your face

You walk on straight
Yeah tell the motherfuckers they were wrong
Isn't this your sweetest revenge
Feels good, hey I told you so

'Cause every night has a day
Every wish has a prayer
Don't loose your faith
And I'll be holding your hand
'Cause it's never too late
There's someone who needs you

So break down that wall, baby
There's a new world out there waiting
Just tear down that wall, girl
Run away and don't look back
Break down that wall
Break down that wall

So break down that wall, baby
There's a new world out there
Tear down that wall, girl
Run away run away run away
Break down that wall
Break down that wall

'Cause I need you




 Feels like I have a pillow pulled over my head
Nearly every night I wake up grasping for air
As you slowly dive a grave, so you could bury me alive
And I see you suffocate in dreams and you lie
Breathe in, gotta breathe out
No fear 'cause they won't come around
Breathe in, breathe out
I'm your ride and leave my burdens down
God will you forgive them for they fail to leap their faith
Take away their pain, their blinds and teach them
How to love instead of hatin'
Don't they seek that love for free, these gods got a hold on me
Despite the crap you put me through, I can say I still got love for you!
Breathe in, gotta breathe out
No fear, no they won't come around
Breathe in, and breathe out
I'm your ride and I'm your right
(Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out)
[???]
Won't defeat me
In my heart I'll have to be this careless
Just let me, let me let me
Let me breathe baby
I got to breathe baby
Let me breathe
I got to breathe baby
Let me breathe
Let me breathe baby
You gotta get it get it get it, gotta let me breathe

I'm still walking, I'm still walking in the broken glass....
Somewhere, someday, somewhere, I'm still walking on broken glass....
Slowly he moves, turns the lonely pages in his mind
A plaintiff with a cause, he's gonna make it through this wonderland
He's gonna live, live through time.... Yeah.....
Gently he moves, careful not to step on the broken glass, he lost the night
Before....
He's the one, gonna wonder, gonna wonder if it's right or wrong ...
He's gonna live, live through time, yeah yeah yeah yeah.....
Baby...oh yeah, I've got to feel you baby, I'm gonna leave you honey....
There's always something, more I can see
There's always something, something more I can be
There's always something more I can say
There's gonna be a better life for me
I'm gonna find it someday, yeah!
Someday...somewhere...someday.....
Someday, somewhere...someday, somewhere...
Someday...somewhere...someday somewhere ....
Someday...someday, somewhere, someday, somewhere, someday, somewhere, someday

 [Verse 1]
Burn motherfucker, burn motherfucker, burn in hell
The rage was in my soul and I can tell
I want you to burn motherfucker, burn motherfucker, burn in hell
'Cause bringing me down and popping my car was shit

[Pre-Chorus]
You are taking up too much space

[Chorus 1]
Cold and heartless
Like I won't behave
I was worth your guidance
Being used to a slave
But I can't live in a lie
Do you really wanna do this?
Oh, and fake it till we die
Fake it till we die, oh

[Verse 2]
Burn motherfucker, burn motherfucker, straight to hell
Pretend to be my lover, lover, but it don't sleep well, yeah
Burn motherfucker, burn motherfucker, burn in hell
I'm amazed how many keep fooling themselves

[Pre-Chorus]
You are taking up too much space

[Chorus 1]
Cold and heartless
Like I won't behave
Was your guidance
Being used to a slave
We could leave behind a lie
Do you really wanna do this?
Oh, and fake it till we die

[Bridge]
I can't anymore
You really never had my back
The one who throws all those words
And then he all turned to black
Now I know I should've never
Trust an innoscent space
'Cause it will never give me
Satisfaction that I crave

[Chorus 2]
Do you really
Do you really wanna do this?
Do you really
Do you really wanna do this, do this?
Do you really
Do you really wanna do this?
(Fake it till we die)
Do you really
Do you really wanna do this, do this?
(Burn in hell)
Do this, do this
Do you really wanna my love, oh
Do you really wanna do this?
Do you really wanna do this?
Do you really wanna do this, do this?
Do you really wanna do this?

[Outro]
I said no, no
No, it will never, never, never give me
I said no, no way
It will never give me the satisfaction that I crave
So let's fake it till we die
Fake it till we die




 [Verse 1]
The man goes for to find out what it is
The madness of the soul in a total bliss
This place we used to live is now a cave
It's where I met my shadows in the darker shades
What happened to the days that we're on fire?
My soul is way too dark for my own desire

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Happiness is gone, my thoughts unclear
No one ever wins these kinds of fights
It's hard for me to focus on what's near in life

[Chorus]
All I wanted was you to love me
I just needed you to care
Hope that you will treat me right
When I needed you to be there
I was building castles in the air

[Verse 2]
I'm tryna see what we were meant to be
But this is a lost cause, it's all I see
We can never go back, walls are broken
We're too hopeless, hope when your heart's not open

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Anywhere I would have followed you
In time I wish you could see
Realize what you've lost when you chose her over me

[Chorus]
'Cause all I wanted was you to love me
I just needed you to care
Hope that you will treat me right
And I needed you to be there
I was building castles in the air

[Bridge]
All of me, take all of me
It's all I have left to give

[Outro]
'Cause all I wanted was you to love me
And I just needed you to care
Hope that you will treat me right
When I needed you to be there
I was building castles in the air
I was building castles in the air




 Cold blackhearted golddiggers
Cold blackhearted golddiggers

I guess that too much generosity
Is making people take you for a fool
And with every opportunity
They'll even try to get some more from you
So they'll cheat and lie
But I will let God deal with the things they do
'Cause when they get their hands on all the gold and paper
They forget to say thank you!

Cold blackhearted golddiggers
Cold blackhearted golddiggers
Cold blackhearted golddiggers
Cold blackhearted golddiggers

But when money brings the things they want
And does it solve the problems that they face
'Cause when everything is said and done
They will find out it's another day
Full of emptiness and lies
And they can't ravish much as they can
But it will never buy them one seat in heaven
Oh when money rules men!

Cold blackhearted golddiggers
Cold blackhearted golddiggers
Cold blackhearted golddiggers
Cold blackhearted golddiggers
Let me tell you
Money's never buy me anything
I said nothing, nothing at all!
I said nothing, baby
I said nothing, baby!
Nothing, nothing, nothing at all!




 [Verse 1]
All you ever do is
Letting it all just pass you by
No need to try
All you ever say is 'Baby, it's alright now'
All you ever do is
Letting the hurt crawl up inside
No need to cry
All you ever say is 'Baby, I feel just fine'

What do you think of me?
Don't you think I see
That you're just hiding from me?
What do you think of me?
Don't you think I see
That you're just lying to me?
Do you think I'm blind sucker?

Open up your eyes
You've got to learn to cry
Baby that's alright baby
Open up your, open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
You've got to learn to cry
Maybe you'll feel just fine

All i ever do is
Waitin' for you to tell me why
You never try
All i ever say
Could you tell me why

All i ever do is
Hoping that you will tell me why
You never cry
All i ever say is
Baby it's alright, it's alright for you to cry

What do you think of me
Don't you think i see
That you're just hiding from me
What do you think of me
Don't you think i see
That you're just lying to me
Do you think i'm blind sucker

Open up your eyes
You've got to learn to cry
Baby that's alright baby
Open up your, open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
You've got to learn to cry
Maybe you'll feel just fine

 Awkward things come to an end
That's why I blocked my heart
And chained it to the wall
Cause you haven't been there at all
In time my house became a place
Where the wrongs were right
And the rights were wrong
With too much drama and pain
Now tell me are you proud of who I am
Can you please help me understand
Why you couldn't love me back
Forgiveness ain't that hard to grasp
Daddy I need to hear you say:
I, I never meant to hurt you
Baby girl, you've got to believe me
I never meant to break your heart
I just wanted to love you
Somehow I didn't know how to
I still blame myself
Unable to receive the love
And affection from you
Like a daughter should
It did far more damage than good
Holding grudges are a waste
Life is way too short
And I just want to let go
Of all the things that I can't change
Now tell me are you proud of who I am
Can you please help me understand
Why you couldn't love me back
Forgiveness ain't that hard to grasp
Daddy, I need to hear you say:
I, I never meant to hurt you
Baby girl, you've got to believe me
I never meant to break your heart
I just wanted to love you
But somehow I didn't know how to
I still blame myself
If I had just one more day
No more promises were made
I would hold you tight
And tell you I love you anyway
If I had just one more day
No more promises were made
I would hold you tight
And tell you I love you anyway
I never meant to hurt you
Baby girl, you've got to believe me
I never meant to break your heart
I just wanted to love you
But somehow I didn't know how to
I still blame myself
You should have been there
You should have been there
For me
For me
For me
You should have been there for me
Where were you baby




 Sittin' on the beach, the island king of love
Deep in fijian seas, deep in some blissful dream
Where the goddess finally sleeps, in the lap of her lover
Subdued in all her rage
And i'm aglow with the taste, of the demons driven outâ€¦
And happily replaced, with the presence of real love
The only one who saves
I wanna dance with you
I see a world where people live and die with grace
The karmic ocean dried up, and leave no trace
I wanna dance with you
I see a sky full of the stars that changed our minds
And lead us back to a world we would not face
The stillness in your eyes, convinces me that i
I don't know a thing
And i've been around the world, and i've tasted all the winds
A half a billion times
Came sickened to your shores, you show me what this life is for
I wanna dance with you
I see a world where people live and die with grace
The karmic ocean dried up and leave no trace
I wanna dance with you
I see a sky full of the stars that changed our minds
And lead us back to a world we would not face
In this altered state ...in this altered stateâ€¦
Full of so much pain and rage
You know we got to find a wayâ€¦
To let it goâ€¦
To let it goâ€¦.to let it goâ€¦.to let it goâ€¦
Sittin' on the beach, the island king of love
Deep in fijian seas, deep in the heart of it all
Where the goddess finally sleeps, after eons of war
And lifetimes she's smilin'
And free, nothin' leftâ€¦
But a cracking voice and a song, oh lord
I wanna dance with you
I see a world where people live and die with grace
The karmic ocean dried up and leave no trace
I wanna dance with you
I see a sky full of the stars that changed our minds
And lead us back to a world we would not face...
We would not face...we would not face....
We would not face...we would not face....




 Day in day I'll keep it out of sight
Things we do without a thought
It never has to end
Draw deadlines, entertain yourself
There's no room for none else
Just leave the world outside
Now do we even care
We all just walk around in a daze
Not knowing what it's all about
Now baby, wouldn't it be great?
If we could turn it all around
Careless people, we'll remind you
We're loosing grip and need a shift
There's no easy way out
Some will tell you that there's nothing gone
Just get on, we'll watch you on
It never has to end
Now do we even care
We all just walk around in a daze
Not knowing what it's all about
Now baby, wouldn't it be great?
If we could turn it all around
One controls all that he sees
But you like to see me crawling
What his body wants to be
But it feels just only falling
Down, once in paradise
One searches his way back home
And I said
What is cool
What is time
What is sport
What is crime
What is death
What is hiding
I'll wake up in time
We all are lost inside the maze
We can find our way home
Not baby, wouldn't it be great?
If we could turn it all around
All around, all around
Turn it all around
All around, all around




 [Verse 1]
My place, five minutes from now
You're not the only one who needs his scrub down
My man, place your love in me
Slowly drifting up to a fantasy

[Chorus]
I, I, I, I'm a dirty girl
Get on top of me
(Get on top of me, get on top of me)
I'm a dirty girl
And I, I'm begging for release
(Begging for release, begging for release)
All that I'm giving, just let me be
A slave to your seduction
Yes, I've been over your torturing
Right before eruption
I'm a dirty girl
With a dirty mind
(Oh oh oh oh)

[Verse 2]
Touch yourself for me, make me want it back
(Make me want it, make me want it, make me want it back)
Give it to me now (give it to me now)
You don't need that, no, you don't, don't

[Chorus]
I'm a dirty girl
Get on top of me
(Get on top of me, get on top of me)
Oh, I'm a dirty girl
Begging for release
(Begging for release, begging for release)
All that I'm giving, just let me be
A slave to your seduction
Yes, I've been over your torturing
Right before eruption
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a dirty girl
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a dirty girl
With a dirty mind, oooh

He he, he he, he he, he he
I'm a dirty girl
(I'm a, I'm a dirty, I'm a, I'm a dirty girl)
I'm begging for release
(Begging for release, begging for release)
Ah ha ha, ah ha ha

Ge-ge-ge-ge-get on top of me
(Dirty girl)

 [Verse 1]
Je staat in de douche en je kijkt me aan
Ik voel, ik ben verliefd
Oh baby, wat heb jij me aangedaan?
Nee, ik wil dit niet
Ik wilde los, lekker latten, maar nee
Het is nu al te laat
Want hoe je kijkt, als je lacht naar mij
Zoals je daar zo staat
Ik wilde niemand binnenlaten in mijn leven
Maar nu staat je naam al heel erg groot
In mijn hart geschreven

[Chorus]
Dominique
Ik ga kapot als ik jou met die andere wijven zie
En wat ze ook beweren, nee, zij zijn het niet
Ik kan niet voor altijd wachten, kom nou alsjeblieft
Zeg me waar we staan, Dominique
Kom op nou, Dominique

[Verse 2]
Onze lichamen bij elkaar
Dansend op de beat
Ik hoop dat jij het ook doorhebt
Beter dan dit wordt het niet
Kijk die sloeries eens brallen
Met hun mond vol slap gelul
Ze denken jou echt te kennen
Maar ze hebben geen benul
Ze beloven jou de sterren en de maan
Maar wanneer het feest voorbij is
Zien ze jou dan nog steeds staan?
Kom op nou

[Chorus]
Dominique
Ik ga kapot als ik jou met die andere wijven zie
En wat ze ook beweren, nee, zij zijn het niet
Ik kan niet voor altijd wachten, kom nou alsjeblieft
Zeg me waar we staan, Dominique

[Bridge]
Qua liefde heb ik kilometers op de teller
Heb zoveel meegemaakt, jij hoeft me niets meer te vertellen
Ik was van de liefde zo vervreemd
Maar het voelt toch zo verdomde goed
Wanneer jij me in je armen neemt
Dominique
Dominique
Nee, zij zijn het niet
Kom op nou, Dominique
Kom op nou, Do

[Outro]
Luister
Er is maar een die jou kan beminnen
Da's een echte vrouw
En dat ben ik, en ik vertel je nu
Dat ik van je hou
Er is maar een die jou kan beminnen
Da's een echte vrouw
En dat ben ik, en ik vertel je nu
Dat ik van je hou
Do-do-dominique
Dominique
Do-do-dominique
Kom op nou, Dominique
Do-do-dominique
Do-do-dominique
Ik hou van jou, Dominique
Do-do-dominique
Ik hou van jou, Dominique
Dominique
Do-do-dominique
Do-do-do-do-do-do-dominique

 [Verse 1]
I'm a lone wolf in sheep's clothing, that's no lie
But I'm as sweet as nectar to the naked eye
I'm about to burn, I’ve got the fire all over me
And it's alarming how fast it brings you to your knees

[Chorus]
Down daddy down
Daddy daddy down down
Go down
Down daddy down
Daddy daddy down down
Bow down
Down daddy down
Daddy daddy down down
Go down
On me
Down daddy down

Bow down
On me

You sure love my legs and what is in between
Spare me the eyes when you’re eating me alive
Just open that mouth and give that tongue some exercise

Down daddy down
Daddy daddy down down
Go down
Down daddy down
Daddy daddy down down
Bow down
Down daddy down

Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
No, you don't know who you're dealin' with dirty boy
No, you don't know who you're dealin' with dirty boy




 I know you've been lyin' boy
Every single word you say
It's the way your lips shake
When you're
Getting down and dirty baby

Don't you ask me how I know
And why it's time for you to go
'Cause you should've known better
Before you were
Ge-ge-getting down and dirty baby

Oh
I know I ain't supposed to cry
But I can't keep it inside
Cheater, yeah!
Thinking you could get away
But you don't know who you're dealin' with, heey

All the love we had is gone
You gave it to the other ones
You're neve gonna find a love like mine
The way I'm
Getting down and dirty baby

Now you're crying on my phone
You should've done that months ago
And now it's time for me to
Ge-ge-getting down and dirty baby

Oh

But I can't keep it inside
Cheater, yeah!
Thinking you could get away
But you don't know who you're dealin' with, heey

Cheater, yeah!
Thinking you could get away
But you don't know who you're dealin' with, heey
No, you don't!

I let you buy just a little time
So I could find a way to say 'goodbye'
A little more time before I slam the door in your face
So tired of the heartache and the nights I lie, awake

I know I ain't supposed to cry
But I can't keep it inside
Cheater, yeah!
Thinking you could get away
But you don't know who you're dealin' with, heey

Cheater, yeah!
Thinking you could get away
But you don't know who you're dealin' with, oh

Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye

No, you don't know who you're dealin' with dirty boy




 Now I believe that what I used to think was a lie
Is really alive
Now I can see there’s only one place to reach
Only one thing to preach and that’s the highest
It’s the strangest thing that I can feel so much

There is no reason, there is no logic to feelings
‘Cause when love is the dealer I’m addicted
So fascinated, I can’t stop this constant craving
You’re contagious
It’s the strangest thing that I can feel so much
For someone, somehow (2x)

(chorus)
And I cannot hide, even if I’d try
You mean everything to me
Any fool can see, what you’ve done to me
You mean everything to me
And when you’re not here, I just cry
And when you’re not here, I could die

The best is still to come dear
The best is still to come for us (2x)

It’s the strangest thing that I can feel so much
For someone, somehow (2x)

Chorus...

 I got my head in the clouds
Running from the thunder
Proud as I can be I am
Waiting for the grey to replace the black in me
Daddy, will the sun come up again
You and me, we fail to see
Nothing lasts forever
It's plain to see, you will agree
It's hard to stay together
Will we keep the thieves away
Will we both remember
To make the best of every chance
Or will we just surrender
Shouldn't we be making
Any effort needed to
Stop our dreams from fading
The sky is fading black to blue
We should be together
I am runnin' out of faith
And it takes something more each time
Before I put my heart in your hands daddy
You and me, did we fail to see
No one stays together
No it won't be easy
You will agree
To make this a forever
Will we keep the thieves away
Will we both remember
To make the best of every chance
Or will we just surrender
Shouldn't we be making
Any effort needed to
Stop our dreams from fading
Fading, fading, fading, fading, ooh




 Another day is here another drama will appear
And I think it's time that I gave my mind a break
I'm feeling used and abused and misunderstood
I gotta find me a place
Where there's no one else around
Every time I see you walking away
My head's spinning around
No I never feel the same

I didn't know what I had baby 'til it was gone
No nothing even matters even matters at all to me
No more

I ain't done much lately
Sleeping and staring at the wall
Watchin' TV
And even though I'm down still

I have faith in my moon

Well I said hey get rid of it

Photographs of you here in my room
Reminding my heart and soul that I still love you
Whenever I'm with you it's wearing me out
No matter what you do you're the one I love
Now baby where did we go
Did we give it a chance
'Cause everything is about to go down tonight
And as I said before
I didn't know what I had baby 'till it was gone
No nothing even matters even matters at all to me
No more

And while you're out there in search of you
And try to keep it all together
Where were you when I needed you

I have faith in my moon

Well I said hey get rid of it




 Relationship lost on a stormy sea
I hold on to you
Just hold on to me
When the lighting strikes
You hear the thunder roaring
And you don't know how long
This will go on

But I know I still love you
And I know you still care
So keep on tryin' when you're sure you still love me

I don't know much
But I know how to love you
Doesn't that mean anything
I don't know much
But I know how to love you

A sea of love
Don't let it drown us
We're way too far from shore
As we go deeper
As the wind grows stronger
It tries to tip us over
But we both learned how to swim
So let's just go on

'Cause I know I still love you
And I know you still care
So keep on tryin' when you're sure you still love me

I don't know much
But I know how to love you
Doesn't that mean anything
I don't know much
But I know how to love you

Yeah I know I still love you
And I know you still care

I don't know much
But I know how to love you, yeah
Doesn't that mean anything
I don't know much
But I know how to love you

And that's all I need to know
Yeah that's all I need to know babe
Oh that's all I need to know
That's all I need to know
For now




 [Verse 1]
I've been sleepin' all day
Slummin' all night in a 44 hour sedation
Since the day you cut me out of your life
The night I killed your patience

[Pre-Chorus]
Always tried to lie to you
The truth is that I love you
I need you more than anything
Without you I discover, I'm a maniac and a menace
Headin' for destruction

[Chorus]
Your lips, I miss your tears
Your hips, your piss, your blood
The way you function
Maybe I should thank some god
For your amazing fluid conduction

[Verse 2]
It was max, the king of facts
(It was max, it was max, it was max)
He made me steal for your number
I promised not to tell on him
But you know me, I'm a sucker

[Pre-Chorus]
Always tried to lie to you
The truth is that I love you
I need you more than anything
Without you I discover, I'm a maniac and a menace
Headin' for destruction

[Chorus]
Your lips, I miss your tears
Your hips, your piss, your blood
The way you function
Maybe I should thank some god
For your amazing fluid conduction
Your kiss, I miss your tears
Your fingertips, my satisfaction
I swear that I could thank some god
For your amazing fluid conduction

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Your kiss, I miss your tears
Your fingertips, my satisfaction
I swear that I could thank some god
For your amazing fluid conduction
You, you, you, you, you, you, you
I swear that I could thank some god
For your amazing fluid conduction
Your hips, your piss, your blood
The way you function
Maybe I should thank some god
For your amazing fluid conduction
C'mon
Swear that I could thank some god




 Haven't we both heard enough babe
This is what we're gonna do
Let me put my arms around you once more
There's nothing left here to prove

Walk away just a little bit slower
Better hold on tight, will we ever learn to let it go
Break Through to the other side
I keep wondering
When were you ever gonna let me know
That you just wanted something else in life

What do you say when it's all over
What do you know when nothing's going right
The troubles in your mind
What do you do when you get lost inside your soul
Where do you go when love's gone
What do you say nothing at all

It was so hard when I watched you falling down
But it was time for you to walk alone
Just know if you really need a friend
And you're feeling like you can't go on

Just walk back just a little bit faster
Take my hand I will blow your fears away
Break through to the other side
For bitter or worse I know you better than anyone else
And I'll be by your side

What do you say when it's all over
What do you do when it's all gone
What do you do when you get lost inside your soul
Where do we go when love's gone
What do you say nothing at all

When it all becomes reality
That this is where it ends for you and me
I'm about to lose my mind
Will love find a way on time
Please don't try and kiss these tears away
We know we've both have made mistakes
If I could do it all again
I wouldn't change a single thing

What do you say when it's all over
What do you do when it's all gone
What do you do when you get lost inside your soul
Where do we go when love's gone
What do you say nothing at all
What do you say nothing at all
What do you say nothing at all




 Haven't we both heard enough babe
This is what we're gonna do
Let me put my arms around you once more
There's nothing left here to prove
Walk away just a little bit slower
Better hold on tight, will
We ever learn to let it go
Break Through to the other side
I keep wondering when were you
Ever gonna let me know
That you just wanted
Something else in life
What do you say when it's all over
What do you know when nothing's going
Right the troubles in your mind
What do you do when you
Get lost inside your soul
Where do you go when love's gone
What do you say nothing at all
It was so hard when I watched you falling down
But it was time for you to walk alone
Just know if you really need a friend
And you're feeling like you can't go on
Just walk back just a little bit faster
Take my hand I will blow your fears away
Break through to the other side
For bitter or worse I know
You better than anyone else
And I'll be by your side
What do you say when it's all over
What do you do when it's all gone
What do you do when you
Get lost inside your soul
Where do we go when love's gone
What do you say nothing at all
When it all becomes reality
That this is where it ends for you and me
I'm about to lose my mind
Will love find a way on time
Please don't try and kiss these tears away
We know we've both have made mistakes
If I could do it all again
I wouldn't change a single thing
What do you say when it's all over
What do you do when it's all gone
What do you do when you
Get lost inside your soul
Where do we go when love's gone
What do you say nothing at all
What do you say nothing at all
What do you say nothing at all




 [Verse 1]
Girl, girl, girl, when I hear him talk
Ooh, my mind gets blocked, girl
Speak up 'cause my jaw is locked
Which is good, good for me, girl
It hides like a warning sign
But I'm too blind to see

[Pre-Chorus]
Speak up, yes, I'm coming down
With an ice cold fever
Ice cold fever, ice cold fever
Still got my hands, they're clinging
So I just keep going

[Chorus]
I don't know where I belong
Could I belong to you?
No, I don't know where I belong
Could I belong?

[Verse 2]
Girl, girl, girl, get it while it's hot they say
You see I'm burning up here
I want to but I just can't stop
And it hurts, it hurts like hell, girl
You turn me inside out and upside down

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you got me head over heels, I'm stuck
Yes, I'm coming down with an ice cold fever
Ice cold fever, ice cold fever, aha
Still got my hands, they're clinging
So I just keep going

[Chorus]
I don't know where I belong
Could I belong to you?
No I don't know where I belong
Could I belong?
Could I belong?

[Bridge]
Still got my hands, they're clinging
So I just keep going

Could I belong to you?
No, I don't know where I belong
Could I belong?

To you, you, you?

 Graduated fool, that is what I am
For every time I failed you
You're so beautiful, I just turned and walked away

I jingle with words, tengle my tongue
Stammering stutters
So I wrote you this song, to finally tell you

We'll be laughing again

 They say that sometimes
You've got to pick up arms and fight
For what you believe is right

Some say
That's just not the way
You will only make things worse

So I close my eyes and turn my head away
And I hope it'll be all right
Fall into a restless sleep
While so many innocent die
That's why I sing

(chorus)
Hail to all of us
Hail to all of us down here (2x)

Maybe someday soon
When we've tought things over
We'll know what to do
But probably
There's a much bigger chance, you see
That it will all be gone

So I close my eyes and turn my head away
And just hope it'll be all right
Fall into a restless sleep
While so many others die
That's why I sing

(chorus 2x)
New York City, London, Jericho
Jerusalem, Sydney, anywhere you wanna go
Capetown, to the moon and back again

(chorus 2x)




 They say that sometimes
You've got to pick up arms and fight

Fall into a restless sleep

 When slowly the night falls
I remember him
Left behind in sadness
He's right under my skin

Your eyes are drifting off
As I start to fade
My trust flushed down the toilet
All the way down the drain

I'm the girl who never seems to get it right
Don't you see the tears I fight to hold inside
I feel myself breaking more and more

(You need a handyman)
Can I hire you to fix my broken heart
(I will do whatever you want me to do)
Repair the holes in me
(I will try)
Before I grow weary
(You need a handyman)
Well as long as you will tell me that you need me
(I will say whatever you want me to say)
Can I buy anything
(It's all for free)
Well, then tell me that you love me

Oh oh hmmm

My heart still cries
I wish he was still here
All of my dreams are now replaced with fear
Visions of the past remain in my mind
Sometimes I have to cry for all the thoughs that I must hide

And I want to dry my eyes and not feel like a fool
What's the thing I need to get head over you
Does anybody out there know what I need

(You need a handyman)
Can I hire you to fix my broken heart
(I will do whatever you want me to do)
Repair the holes in me
(I will try)
Before I grow weary
(You need a handyman)
Oh, as long as you will tell me that you need me
(I will say whatever you want me to say)
Can I buy anything
(It's all for free)
Well, then tell me that you love me

Do you love me?
I need someone to care for me, yeah
Tell me what I need
Can anybody tell me

A handyman
A handyman
That is what you need, girl
A handyman
A handyman
That is what you need, girl




 I Suppose there are disagreements
But I can
I can still remember
Who we were
Who we were before we forgot
There we go
Round and round
We walk straight to the point
Of who will decide what is fair or not
In our minds we are both free
It's all we got

Let us agree
To disagree
Don't make a problem
Cause we won't succeed
Oh why do we keep losing our minds

All of our fates are just the same
Don't point your finger
I'll take the blame
Let's try

Solutions are here to find
Heaven should be on our minds

'Cause memories
They can turn to something like daydreams
Now we're on the shimmering shades of blue

Does your heart miss mine and feel so lost to?

Please don't let this be the fall of the dreams we had
Of you and me making it through it all
Forget wrong or right
Don't wait for things to fall

Let us agree to disagree
Don't make a problem
'cause we won't agree
Oh why do we keep losing our minds

'Cause all of our fates are just the same
Don't point your finger
I'll take the blame

Let's try
Solutions are here to find
Remember
Heaven should be on our mind

Heaven should be on our mind
Let us agree to disagree
Don't make more problems
'cause we won't agree
Oh why
Why?
Heaven should be on our...
Minds
Remember
Remember
Oh heaven
Oh heaven
Should be on our minds




 [Verse 1]
To this generation
We cannot forget
The ones that we have loved
The ones we left behind
Don't be afraid to reach out
This world is changing fast
For those who take a stand

[Chorus]
Heaven knows
We grieve in our life
Don't let us pay the price
(Grief in our life, grief in our life)
So much grief in our life
It will fade over time
(Grief in our life, grief in our life)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, to this generation
It's hard to get along
And we cannot deny
The struggles through this life
It won't do no good to wait
We're running out of time
For those who take a stand

[Chorus]
Heaven knows
We grieve in our life
Don't let us pay the price
(Grief in our life, grief in our life)
So much grief in our life
It will fade over time
(Grief in our life, grief in our life)

[Bridge]
Guilty for we turn the other cheek
Guilty for not willing to achieve
Come on, happiness what's keeping you so long?
How can we forget?
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
We grieve in our life
Don't let us pay the price
(Grief in our life, grief in our life)
Yes we grieve in our life
It will fade over time
(Grief in our life, grief in our life)
Yes, we grieve in our life
It will fade over time
We grieve in our life
Don't let us pay the price
Oh, yeah




 When your world comes crashing down
Don't waste no time
No this world's big enough for you and me
And when you need someone to hold
There's always someone around

Help, help them to help you
Help, help them to help you

'Cause when you're down, down, down
Stand up again
Breathe in
And when you're down, down, down
Come up again
Breathe in

When you feel you're tumblin' down
Now don't you worry
'Cause you'll be back up on your feet again
And when you need someone to hold
There's always someone around

Help, help them to help you
Help, help them to help you

'Cause when you're down, down, down
Come up again
Breathe in
Yeah when you're down, down, down
Stand up again
Hold on

Soon your eyes will see the sun, I believe in love
Is it worth the tears you cry, what about the love
Just leave the past behind, do you believe in love
You are never too far gone to try
To try, yes try, yeah just try

So when you're down, down, down
Stand up again
Breathe in
When you're down, down, down
Come up again
Hold on, hold on

Breathe in, what you're waiting for
Breathe in, you are never too far gone to try
Breathe in, what you're waiting for
Breathe in, soon your eyes will see the sun again
And again and again
Breathe in, soon your eyes will see the sun again
And again and again




 [Verse 1]
Laat me je vertellen wat er na een aantal jaren leven met jou in mij groeit
Ik zal 't in de mooie woorden brengen die jij vast begrijpt, wat er in mij broeit
Want jij en ik waren ooit een koppel, totdat jij me naaide, fuck, het is uit nou
Oh, alles wat jij hebt gedaan, mijn vertrouwen naar de maan, ik wil dat je gaat

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Jij kijkt me aan alsof de wereld vergaat
En dat is waar, ja
Want jij weet niet half wat ik heb doorstaan
Maar het is nu klaar
Jij huichelaar

[Chorus]
Ik heb 't met jouw rotkop gehad
Een waardeloze vent, je bent niets meer dan dat
Ik weet 't nu zeker, jij bent niet diegene die ik dacht dat je was
Want jij hebt alleen maar leugens gebracht
De ene na de ander en niets meer dan dat
Ik weet 't nu zeker, jij bent niet die man voor mij

[Verse 2]
Je lippen die ik heb gekust, je handen warm en zacht, die mooie lach, 't maakte me blij
En nu is toch de tijd gekomen, vreselijk maar waar
Je houdt niet genoeg van mij
Jarenlang gegeven en genomen, klappen opgevangen en bedrogen
Dat is ook wie jij bent
Ik had 't kunnen weten, 't was al lang een ding, maar weet je wat 't is?
Het raakt nooit gewend

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Jij kijkt me aan alsof de wereld vergaat
En da's deels waar, ja
Want niemand die weet wat ik heb doorstaan
Maar het is nu klaar
Oh, jij huichelaar

[Chorus]
Ik heb 't met jouw rotkop gehad
Een waardeloze gast, je bent niets meer dan dat
Ik weet 't nu zeker, jij bent niet diegene die ik dacht dat je was
Want jij hebt alleen maar leugens gebracht
De ene na de ander, niets meer dan dat
Ik weet 't nu zeker, jij bent niet die man voor mij

[Bridge]
Jij bent niet die man voor mij
Jij bent niet die man voor mij

[Chorus]
Ik heb 't met jouw rotkop gehad
Jij, waardeloze chappie, je bent niets meer dan dat
Ik weet 't nu zeker, ja, ik weet 't zeker
Want jij hebt alleen maar leugens gebracht
De ene na de ander, niets meer dan dat
Ik weet 't nu zeker, jij bent niet die man voor mij




 The things you say
In your innocent way
Remind me how it should be
Your love I can trace
In a wide open space
Oh, your beautiful face I've seen

It's the way you walk
And the way that you talk to me
You're God's gift to my world
The prettiest girl
And I feel like I live a dream
The silence I fear
Preach to the morning sun

So just hold me now
I'll stay here all night, cause I
Don't feel so alone when you are
Holding me tight, love

The things you do and say
Always go hand in hand
You're all you seem to be
Not a shred of you pretends

And I will run like a fool
Just to be by your side
Don't hold back, my love
You're my joy in this sad, sad world
You are safe with me
Dream and you will be free

So just hold me now
I'll stay here all night, cause I
Don't feel so alone when you are
Holding me tight, love

Just hold me now
I'll stay here all night, cause I
Don't feel so alone when you are
Holding me tight, love (Holding me tight, love)

And if could have it my way
I'd tell you to stay here always
And I will be waiting for you
I'll be waiting and there's nothing else I can do
You've taken me over

Just hold me now
I'll stay here all night, cause I
Don't feel so alone when you are
Holding me tight, love
Holding me tight, love
Holding me tight, love




 It's funny how situations change
My imagination's playing games
I keep letting you back in my head

The glitter is gone spread your wings and fly
I'll try to keep it civilized
Baby all I wanted was you

Hold on hold on
There's more to come
Hold on lost one
'Cause there's some more

No one's ever hurt me more than you
I broken down in two pieces
And everything I sing is already been sung

Look at all these scars written on my skin
Some people find them hard to see
Now who will I be when
I'm not with you anymore

Hold on hold on
There's more to come
Hold on lost one
'Cause there's some more

You found yourself another place to hide
I can't believe that it's all set and done
I pray to God for you your choice was right
The time has come for me to let us go

Hold on hold on
There's more to come
Hold on lost one
'Cause there's some more




 I have drunk virginia water
I have dug my own gravesend
Set my foot ashore in new port
Travelled far beyond my landsend
And home is in my head
I have dived into a blackpool
With a maidstone around my neck
I just drifted into the southsea
With no hull beyond my deck
And home is in my head
Well I have lost a wheel in barrow
Try to cross the no one cambridge
When my liverpool grey shallow
Had to dig more wells in turnbridge




 It's easier not to be wise
And measure these things by your brains
I sank into Eden with you
Alone in the church by and by
I'll read to you here, save your eyes
You'll need them your boat is at sea
Your anchor is up, you've been swept away
And the greatest of teacher's won't hesistate
To leave you there by yourself
Chained to faith
I alone love you
I alone tempt you
I alone love you
Fear is not the end of this!
I alone love you
I alone tempt you
I alone love you...
It's easier not to be great
And measure these things by your eyes

Alone in the church by and by
To cradle the baby in space
And leave you there by yourself
Chained to faith
I alone love you
I alone tempt you
I alone love you
Fear is not the end of this!
I alone love you
I alone tempt you
I alone love you
Yeah

All come running back to you
All these rhythms that you hide
Only love can save us now
All these riddles that you burn
YEAH YEAH YEAH!!
I alone love you
I alone tempt you

Fear is not the end of this!
I alone love you

 Just because I may act like I know everything you like
It doesn't mean my hands don't shake
Got burning eyes, inside I die
Look around the prone of grace I'm living in
The last days I couldn't tell the rights from wrongs
It's all the same
I lift away
Dreams are still, the truth is
That I don't know nothing
And I don't know why

(Chorus)
All the answers I don't have
Make me feel so worthless
God knows what lies ahead
So unreal as I rely on lies instead of what I feel
Overwhelmed by modern days
Is there a right place in this life?
I couldn't tell
In fact Iâ¦ don't know nothing
No, I don't know why

(Chorus)
All the answers I don't have
Make me feel so worthless
God knows what lies ahead




 [Verse 1]
We're breaking things we can't repair
None of us will take them blame
No nothing can be done this time
All the memories that we've made
I trew them all away
There's no need to talk it over
Don't let me get you down
Let's just move on
I am setting you free

[Chorus]
'Cause I dont wanna hurt no more
No, I don't wanna make you go
Through one more rainy day
No I don't wanna hurt no more
Strange enough I always knew
I'm taking off today
Dont wanna hurt no more

[Verse 2]
Darkness you left in my soul
Now do we know how much we've lost?
Will the moon be shining as bright as before
And as I am singing this song
The tears went up in my eyes
And I will always wonder
Why I will never have the life I wanted
Now I'm letting it go

[Chorus]
Cause I dont wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna make you go
Through one more rainy day
No I don't wanna hurt no more
There's not much more to say
Cause it's to late now
I won't hurt no more...

[Brigde]
So I'll wait 'till morning comes
You made it clear it's been only pain loving me
Things that we dont do for love
I am setting you free

[Chorus]
Cause I don't wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna make you go
Through one more rainy day
No I don't wanna hurt no more
Strange enough I always knew
I'm taking off today
I'm letting you go...




 You've got it easy but you've got the nerve to make a face
Although I'm struggling you can tell because I keep the page
We're out together but I feel you're pushing me aside
Lend me a hand sometimes
The thought won't even cross your mind
You need to take a good look at yourself

'Cause I'm about to close our jar
If you need a servant girl, find someone else
Time to step up

'Cause if I go, I'd be taking more with me
Than you would care to lose
Time is up, step it up
Or you see me walk away
Just so you know
Nothing you can do can make me turn around again
Time is up, step it up
Or you see me walk away
If we're together why you're pushing me away?
You're taking chances boy, we're getting closer to the day
You need to take a good look at yourself
Cause I'm about to close our jar
If you need a servant girl find someone else
It's time to step up
Cause if I go
I'd be taking more with me
Than you would care to lose
Time is up, step it up
Or you see me walk away
Just so you know
Nothing you can do can make me turn around again
Time is up, step it up
Or you see me walk away
Cause if I go
I'd be taking more with me than you would care to lose
Time is up, step it up
Or you see me walk away
Just so you know
Nothing you can do can make me turn around again
Time is up, step it up
Or you see me walk away




 You've got it easy but you've got the nerve to make a face
Although I'm strugglin' you can't tell because I keep it caged
We are together but I feel you're pushing me aside
Lend me a hand sometime the thought won't even cross your mind
You need to take a good look at yourself
'cause I'm about to close up shop
If you need a servant go find someone else
It's time to step up
'Cause If I go
I'll be taking more with me than you would care to lose
Time is up step it up or you'll see me walk away
Just so you know
Nothing you can do could make me turn around again
Your time is up step it up or you'll see me walk away
If we're together why you're pushing me away

It's time to step up
I said it's time to step it up
Yeah time to step up
Time to step it up
I said it's time babe to step it up
Step it up




 [Verse 1]
Why was I waiting for tomorrow? Why didn't I take the time?
To say "I'm sorry" and that we were fine
If I knew it'd be the last time I would see you walking out the door
I'd give you hugs and kisses and call you back for more
I would say "I love you more than you will ever know"
And hold you so close to my heart and ask you never to let go

[Chorus]
If I knew that this would be the last time that I'll see your face
I would stop and say "I need you every day"
But now you're gone, my love
What do you say when words are not enough?

[Verse 2]
A prayer in a peaceful place with God by your side
Still can't believe it's true, I wasn't ready to say goodbye
Baby, I'm still lost without you, there's so much that I wanted to say
I'm lost in a sea of time, but it's a little too late
I hope you knew I loved you so, each and every day
Did you know you taught me to live to the fullest every day?

[Chorus]
If I knew that this would be the last time that I'll see your face
I would stop and say "I need you every day"
But now you're gone, my love
What do you say when words are not enough?
If I knew that this would be the last time that I'll see your face
What do you say when words just don't mean enough?
Now you're gone, my love
Gone, gone, gone

[Bridge]
Even on the darkest days and on my greyest nights
When my tears poured out like rain, you'd be the one that made me smile
Now my days go by and back without you

[Chorus]
If I knew that this would be the last time that I'll see your face
I would stop and say "I need you every day"
But now you're gone, my love
What do you say when words are not enough?

 Hey girlfriend, I just met a man
And he's kinda sweet and ain't afraid to tell the truth
He knows when to take my hand
Hey girlfriend, he seems like the perfect guy
And he makes me feel one like I've never felt before
And although it feels so right

But I can't help but wonder
Oh, oh, I don't know
Can we get along?
Can we get along?
Oh, oh, I don't know
Can we get along?
Can we get along?
In the long term

Will you say "let him in"?
'Cause good men are so hard to find
Let him love, let him hold you
Let him give you a broken heart
He will never play your mind
Please, help me, with all this haze in my mind
I don't wanna lose control
I'm afraid to love him and get blinded by the light

But I can't help but wonder
Oh, oh, I don't know
Can we get along?
Can we get along?
Oh, no, I don't know
Can we get along?
Can we get along?
Oh, oh, I don't know
Can we get along?
Can we get along?
Oh, oh, I don't know
Can we get along?
Can we get along?
In the long term
In the long term

But I can't help but wonder
But I can't help but wonder
Can we get along?




 [Verse 1]
Vrij bij mij, ’t is al veels te lang geleden
Kijk naar mij, laten we alles geven
Want ik mis je
Ja, I do
Baby hou me vast
Het is al veels te lang geleden
Want je hoort bij mij
Je zou het haast vergeten
Ja ik mis je
Ja, I do

[Pre-Chorus 1]
De liefde in je ogen is verdwenen
Maar God ik mis het lachen wat we deden
Je hart voelt nu zover van de mijne
Oh, ik mis je, ik mis je

[Chorus]
En jouw stem, nu met een koude ondertoon, hmm
Wat je ooit zo bijzonder vond aan mij
Dat vind je nu gewoon
En wat jij denkt
Kan ik alleen nog maar naar gissen
Op papier hebben we alles, maar mijn hart zegt
Dat we iets missen

[Verse 2]
Blijf bij mij, wil je dit echt op gaan geven?
Ik wil ook niet meer in deze spanning leven
Ja ik voel, jou, I do
Ik wil me weer verbonden met je voelen
Samen lachen, en samen lekker kroelen
Want ik mis je
Oh ja, ja, ja, ja, I do

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Je zegt dat je niet meer weet wat je voelt
Wie we samen zijn en wat je vindt
En wat ons in het dagelijkse leven
Oh, behalve onze kinderen nog verbindt

[Chorus]
En jouw stem, nu met een koude ondertoon
En wat je ooit bijzonder vond aan mij
Dat vind je nu gewoon, hmm
En wat jij denkt
Kan ik alleen nog maar naar gissen
Op papier hebben we alles, maar mijn hart zegt
Dat we iets missen

[Outro]
Weg van alles, weg van hier
We doen het gewoon opnieuw
Maar ik mis je
Weg van alles, weg van hier
We doen het gewoon opnieuw
Want ik mis je




 You tell me that you need to spend sometime alone
You tell me that you think it's best if i'd go home now
I get my coat from off the floor, I'm out the door
Walking home alone, my love has left

(chorus)
My head, my heart all torn apart
My minds exploding
Crying my eyes out over you

It must be hard for you to believe that I might love you
Just try to understand I just want you to want me too
You made me fall in love again, you angel
How you tak my breath away, Ilive for you

(chorus)
It must be hard for you to believe that I might love you anyway
Just try to understand I just wanted you to want me too

(chorus)
I live for you, why won't you live for me




 It's not what I needed or what I wanted, but then again
Living a lie, I couldn't go on another day
There must have been a way to busy adoring you
It's over, oh oh
I hear hello, holding on my phone and I can't recall
That I ever felt this sad in my whole life before
My blood runs cold and honestly
I feel lonely, baby, so lonely, baby
These days are just way to bright
I need a reason to believe
'Cause I keep telling myself
That we are still in love
Even though you took off and broke my heart
And letting me know that I ain't the one you're looking for
Oehh, why do I keep telling myself
That we are still in love
Even though you took off and broke my heart
And letting me know that I ain't the one you need, no
We're talking all night to a filthy sky and some rain
I'm tryin' to find just little bits of yesterday
I guess you never knew how much I needed you, ooh
It's over
And handle it, covering my eye so I can see
Something's angels always what they seem to be
Things in my mind keep flashing by
What's going on, what the hell is going on
These days are just way to bright
I need a reason to believe, yeah
'Cause I keep telling myself
That we are still in love
Even though you took off and broke my heart
And letting me know that I ain't the one you're looking for
Ooh, why do I keep telling myself
That we are still in love
Even though you took off and broke my heart
And letting me know that I ain't the one you need, no
Ooohhhh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Oohhh, no
We're living a lie, baby, oh
We're living a lie, baby
We're living a lie, baby
We're living a lie, baby

Lie now, heeyy, he-he-he-he
He-he-he-he

 So many times i've cried
When dark clouds block the sunlight
And it's raining in my heart
I'll keep my head up high

So little time to try
To find out, about the feeling
That's deep inside of you
And keeps the dream alive

So remember
When you're down and out
In the sand

So many minds are torn
By overloading senses
You're breathing in and out
No second left to sigh

Can you tell me why
Nobody will tell me
What they're feeling deep inside
We're all just telling lies

Every time you wonder
Why the feeling lingers
And it's stuck inside your soul
You're crying when you smile

So remember
When you're down and out

When you're stuck in the middle
When you can't solve the riddle
Lay it down in the sand
When you can't help but shiver
Get you finger off the trigger
Lay it down in the sand

Get it out your head
Out of your hands
Lay it down in the sand
So remember
When you're down and out
When everything's missing
And there's nobody listening
Lay it down in the sand
When you can't help but shiver
Get you finger off the trigger
Lay it down in the sand

Get it out your head
Out of your hands
Lay it down
In the sand

 Listen up
When the sky's turnin' grey
You'll be right here
You turn the light back on
When I lost my way
And when I trip and I fall
You pick me up
Forget all mistakes that I have made
Yeah I got love

Yeah I've got love for my friends
For quite some time
They would not hesitate
To help me out
And though my pain keeps on showing
They take the time
And realize I do love them now hear me out

'Cause I'm singing this song for you'
And this is my way of letting you know and say
'Thank you'

In this world
No one can replace you
Nobody's ever going to erase you
In this world
No one can replace you
Nobody's ever going

To all the men that I loved in my life
Thank you for letting me know I ain't always right
Back in the days there was nothing I wouldn't do
I went through all of the fires to be with you

And though I was getting tired
Of the same old thing
You all took me places I've never been
And I love you for that

In this world
No one can replace you
Nobody's ever going to erase you
In this world
No one can replace you
Nobody's ever going to erase you yeah

When no one else is around
I stay with you
Whether you're up or you're down
That's what I'll do

In this world
No one can replace you
Nobody's ever going to erase you
In this world
No one can replace you
Nobody's ever going to erase you




 I spy, I spy a tear in your eye
So I'll try, I'll try to get you out of here
You sigh, just move a little closer
Time flies, soon the night is over
Morning, noon, night, all day
All I ever wanted was for you to come my way
We've got time so let it slide
Roll me over get on top
Yes baby let's turn off the lights
And make an end to my lonely
An end to my an end to my
An end to my an end to my
An end to my an end to my lonely
An end to my an end to my
An end to my an end to my
An end to my an end to my
I'm high, so high when you're with me
I might, I might stay all night
You, oh my, you're such a wild boy
Yeah time flies, soon the night is over
Morning, noon, night, all day
All I ever wanted was for you to come my way
We've got the time so let it slide
Roll me over get on top
Yes baby let's just lose our mind
And make an end to my
An end to my an end to my
An end to my an end to my
An end to my an end to my

 [Verse 1]
It's a shame the rules change, not the game
Such a shame it's the same
Now everything's in vain
All in vain, it's such a shame
Could it be true that there's nothing left to do
For me and you? Can't be true
We all can't be such fools
Could life be so cruel?
Could life be so cruel?

[Chorus]
Maybe I don't even try fearing what I'd find
Guess I am a number on the line
Could you please tell me why
We're on the same line, and we're fallin' behind on life?

[Verse 2]
Life is great, I'm walking in the sun and everything is cool
Yeah, it's true, there's so much we can do
It feels so right, yeah, it's all right

[Chorus]
Maybe I don't even try fearing what I'd find
Guess I am a number on the line
Could you please tell me why?
Baby, I don't even wanna try fearing what I'd find
Guess I am a number on the line
Could you please tell me why we're on the same line
And we're fallin' behind, fallin' behind on life?

Oh, it's a shame
It's a shame
Oh, it's a shame
It's a shame
It's a shame
Such a shame
It's a shame




 [Verse 1]
I'm just thinkin' about the child in me
That I sometimes feel inside
And I'm figuring out just what it is
That makes me feel so small
Is it you that hurts me when I give myself?
Every day and every night
Am I too blind to see that it doesn't work out?
Did I really ask too much of you, baby?

[Chorus]
Do you mean to tell me that's the way it is?
Do you mean to say?
It's all so hard, it's so hard
It's all so hard, it's so hard

[Verse 2]
As I search for an answer, I see the clear blue sky
And I know that you're the one to blame
And I feel so naive
When you say that our love to you was just a game
I dream, my dream, I'm sane, I'm insane
Oh, please don't, please don't speak to me that way

[Chorus]
Do you mean to tell me that's the way it is?
Do you mean to say?
It's all so hard, it's so hard
It's all so hard, it's so hard
Damned, it's so hard, why you're so hard?
Why you're so hard?
It's tearing me apart

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Do you mean to tell me that's the way it is?
Do you mean to say?
It's all so hard, yeah, all so hard
Why you're so hard?
It's tearing me apart
It's all so hard, it's all so hard
It's all so hard, tearing me apart




 I'm just thinkin' about the child in me
That I sometimes feel inside
And I'm figuring out just what it is
That makes me feel so small

Is it you, that hurts me when I give myself
Every day and every night
Am I too blind to see that it doesn't work out
Did I really ask too much of you baby
Do you mean to tell me that's the way it is
Do you mean to say

It's all so hard, It's so hard
It's all so hard, It's so hard

As I search for an answer, I see the clear blue sky
And I know that you're the one to blame
And I feel so na've
When you say that our love to you was just a game
I dream, my dream, I'm sane, I'm insane
Oh, please don't, please don't speak to me that way
Do you mean to tell me that's the way it is
Do you mean to say

It's all so hard, It's so hard
It's all so hard, It's so hard
Damned it's so hard, why you're so hard
Why you're so hard, It's tearing me apart




 I'm just thinkin' about the child in me
That I sometimes feel inside
And I'm figuring out just what it is
That makes me feel so small
Is it you, that hurts me when I give myself
Every day and every night
Am I too blind to see that it doesn't work out
Did I realy ask too much of you baby
Do you mean to tell me that's the way it is
Do you mean to say
It's all so hard, it's so hard
It's all so hard, it's so hard
As I search for an answer, I see the clear blue sky
And I know that you're the one to blame
And I feel so naive
When you say that our love to you was just a game
I dream, my dream, I'm sane, I'm insane
Oh, please don't, please don't speak to me that way
Do you mean to tell me that's the way it is
Do you mean to say
It's all so hard, it's so hard
It's all so hard, it's so hard
Damned it's so hard, why you're so hard
Why you're so hard, it's tearing me apart




 Can you tell me how you feel
When you turn on your tv
When you see me singing through my tears
I've saved up all these years
Can you tell me what you see
When you read the magazines
Do you see yourself in me
When you read the magazines
When the dj plays this song
Can you tell me what you hear

And i hope you feel the way we felt
When you put us all through hell
Can you tell me how you feel now
How do feel, how do you feel
Tell me how you sleep at night
Do you take those pills like me
Or do you toss and turn
And lay your head on the pillow and fall asleep
Cause you just don't care
How do you feel

And now i'm in your face
And you feel that empty space
Why did we how did we come to fall from grace
Falling, falling
Didn't you just hear us calling out
No there's nothing left to say
Cause you shouldn't have stayed away
No man leaves his flesh and blood this way

And i hope you feel the way we felt
When you put us all through hell
Can you tell me how you feel now
How do feel, how do you feel
Tell me how you sleep at night
Do you take those pills like me
Or do you toss and turn
And lay your head on the pillow and fall asleep
Cause you just don't care
How do you feel

It took a crowd for me to see
That it really wasn't me
The swaying crowd is the cleansing rain
It took the pain away
And i hope you'll find yourself alone
In a million dollar home
You will be stuck
With a heart like a rock
I hope you run out of luck fool
How do you feel now
Does it hurt, does it hurt
How do you feel now
I'm just wonderin' how it feels

 If I had nothing
Would you die for me?
If I ever lose my mind
Would you fight for me?
Cause lately you
Haven't been around
I am still waiting babe
To be found

Do any of your ladies ever get tired
Tired of being strong
Still trying to make things right
When he's going to long?

No I won't play that game no more
Cause you will never know how bad it hurts
When my love isn't shattered in pieces on the floor
I won't play that game no more
No more tears on my pillow case
Only one step away from the trouble and mess you made
You made

The night's so cold
And I am all alone
And I have been way to long
On my own
Probably you
Couldn't care less
If I would sufficate
From loneliness

Do any of your ladies ever get tired
Not knowing where you stand?
But still you can help yourself
From nothing than me

I won't play that game no more
Cause you will never know how bad it hurts
When my love isn't shattered in pieces on the floor
I won't play that game no more
No more tiers on my pillow case
Only one step away from the trouble and mess you made

Think about all your lies
As I walk away from you
Leaving me here to cry
There's nothing left to do
So get out of my life
I won't make up my mind no!

I won't play that game no more
Cause you will never know how bad it hurts
When my love isn't shattered in pieces on the floor
I won't play that game no more
No more tiers on my pillow case
Only one step away from the trouble and mess you made

No I won't play that game no more
No more
No more
No more
I had enough
I had enough
No more

Sir, can you tell me how to get to Jerusalem?
'Cause I have kinda lost my way
Sir, will you help me get there as fast as I can?

 [Verse 1]
Met een lach, en een traan
Denk ik terug aan toen, 'k zie ons staan
Je keek me aan, en je zei
“Hey kom jij eens even hier bij mij”
Je kuste me, lang en zacht
En ik weet nog wel dat ik dacht
Dat liefde ver te zoeken was
’t Was een goed moment, heel onverwacht
En ja, ‘k heb er vaak aan teruggedacht
Hoe je me toen hebt liefgehad

[Chorus]
Want tot nu toe zag ik liefde
Alleen maar in m’n dromen
Maar nu was het toch eindelijk ook op mijn pad gekomen
Het bleek juist allemaal zoveel dichterbij
Zal het nooit vergeten
Want ineens, daar was jij
Ja ja, jij
Jij

[Verse 2]
‘k Was gelukkig maar, nooit compleet
En nu dus wel, ‘k hoop dat je ’t weet
Door die glimlach en je mooie huid
Kijk ik elke dag m’n ogen uit
En oh, de herinnering van toen
‘k Zou het exact zo overdoen

[Chorus]
Want tot nu toe zag ik liefde
Alleen maar in m’n dromen
Maar nu was het toch eindelijk ook op mijn pad gekomen
Het bleek juist allemaal zoveel dichterbij
‘k Zal het nooit vergeten
Want ineens, daar was jij

[Bridge]
Lief voor mij
Grijze wolken verdwijnen
Vanaf toen volg ik waar jij gaat
Mijn hart had nog nooit zo mogen schijnen
Je hebt me laten zien dat het allemaal bestaat

[Chorus]
Ja tot nu toe zag ik liefde
Alleen maar in m’n dromen
En nu was het toch eindelijk ook op mijn pad gekomen
Het bleek juist allemaal zoveel dichterbij
‘k Zal het nooit vergeten
Daar was jij
Ja ja, jij
Baby, jij
Ja, jij




 [Verse 1]
Rain don't depress me
For me they're tears are fire
Feel the warmth when they fall against me

[Verse 2]
And the wind ain't back
For this time of year
Feel alive, I do not live in fear

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We all need to look within ourselves
Find a good insight
(I need this to believe)
'Cause I know that we can only laugh
If we know how to cry
Everybody gets another try

[Chorus]
Keeps getting better
Better till the casket drops
(Take it day by day)
Keeps getting better
Better till the casket drops
(Don't just look away)

[Post-Chorus]
Better, better, better
Better, better
Better, better, better
Better, better

[Verse 3]
Cold weather don't prove
This world remold
'Cause there can't be heat without the cold

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Before things are getting better
The darkness will be bigger
(Just realise)
Sometimes the bullet that you take is for
The one behind the trigger
Everybody gets another try

[Chorus]
Keeps getting better
Better till the casket drops
(Take it day by day)
Keeps getting better
Better till the casket drops
(Don't just look away)

[Post-Chorus]
Better, better, better
Better, better
Everybody gets another try
Better, better, better
Better, better
Everybody gets another try

[Bridge]
Take it day by day
Find a good insight
Don't just look away
We'll get another try
We can find a way into your heart

[Chorus]
Keeps getting better
Better till the casket drops
(Take it day by day)
Keeps getting better
Better till the casket drops
(Don't just look away)

[Outro]
It's never, never
It's never too late
(Better, better)
For a brand new start
Yeah, yeah
It's never too late
(Better, better)
For a brand new start




 Don't kill that man, don't kill that man
He could be the one that brings you gifts for Christmas
Don't kill that man, don't kill that man
He could be the one for free without the dullness
This could be great
Don't just let go
He might be the one to know

(Chorus)
The way you should be loved
A few words I renounce
To lighten up your days with shadows fade away
But I'm not sure he's safe
No, I'm not sure yet
Don't just let go
Don't kill that man, don't kill that man
He could be the one to trust when you've been lied to
Don't kill him yet, don't kill him yet
He could be the one you can turn your blind eye to
This is pure gut
Don't just let go
He could be that man who knows

(Chorus)
The way you should be loved
A few words I renounce
To lighten up your days with shadows fade away
But I'm not sure he's safe
No, I'm not sure yet
He could be that man who knows
Who knows, knows...
Who knows, knows...
Who knows, knows...
(He could be the one, he could be the one)
(He could be the one, he could be the one)
(He could be the one, he could be the one)
(He could be the one, he could be the one)
(He could be the one, he could be the one)
(He could be the one, he could be the one)
